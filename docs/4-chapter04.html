<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>The aim of the work described in this chapter was to investigate the expression of the cloned <em>nirS</em> gene from <em>T. pantotropha</em> in <em>Escherichia coli</em>. Although <em>E. coli</em> does not synthesise the <em>d</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> haem group, and so cannot express holocytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span>, expression studies in this organism are still valuable for two reasons. First, <em>E. coli</em> provides a convenient experimental system to test gene expression, due to its widespread use in molecular biology, the consequent large technical literature, number of methods and range of plasmids available. This means that experiments using <em>E. coli</em> can be carried out with relative ease and efficiency. Second it is probable that in expression systems that can synthesise the holocytochrome (see Chapters 5 and 6), certain site-directed mutants of the nitrite reductase, the ultimate aim of this work, will be inactive and the host cells will be unable to grow under denitrifying conditions because of the accumulation of toxic nitrite. However, using <em>E. coli</em><span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-glockner_copper-containing_1993" role="doc-biblioref">63</a></sup></span> and <em>Ps. putida</em><span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-silvestrini_expression_1992" role="doc-biblioref">268</a></sup></span> it has already proved possible to express the semi-apo enzyme containing only <em>c</em> haem and then to reconstitute the enzyme with purified <em>d</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> haem. The latter approach may be a way of producing sufficient quantities of mutant enzyme for kinetic studies. Previously published data concerning the expression of cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> in <em>E. coli</em> and the expression of other <em>c</em> type cytochromes, both exogenous and endogenous<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-iobbi-nivol_reassessment_1994" role="doc-biblioref">269</a></sup></span> indicated that <em>c</em> haem attachment to the <em>T.pantotropha</em> enzyme should not pose a problem. However, a potential problem was that <em>E. coli</em> is quite distantly related to <em>T. pantotropha</em> and so aspects of its genetics such as promoter sequences and codon usage may be quite different.</p>
<p>Although seven <em>nirS</em> genes have now been sequenced (including that from <em>T. pantotropha</em>, Chapter 3), expression of cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> from the cloned gene has only been studied in any detail for <em>Ps. aeruginosa</em>, <em>Ps. stutzeri</em> Zobell and <em>P. denitrificans</em>. Three organisms have been used as heterologous hosts for expression. Silvestrini et al.Â (1992)<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-silvestrini_expression_1992" role="doc-biblioref">268</a></sup></span> have expressed cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> from <em>Ps. aeruginosa</em> in <em>Ps. putida</em>. In common with <em>E. coli</em> this organism does not make <em>d</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> haem and thus the semi-apoprotein, containing <em>c</em>-haem was produced. Glockner et al.Â (1993)<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-glockner_copper-containing_1993" role="doc-biblioref">63</a></sup></span> have expressed cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> from <em>Ps. stutzeri</em> Zobell in <em>Ps. aureofaciens</em> and <em>E. coli</em> with similar results. Ohshima et al.Â (1993)<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-ohshima_cloning_1993" role="doc-biblioref">140</a></sup></span> have expressed the <em>P. denitrificans</em> IFO 12442 <em>nirS</em> gene in <em>E. coli</em>, but in this case it was claimed that active holoprotein was synthesised. Nitric oxide reductase activity was also apparently detectable in this system. An alternative approach to expression of the <em>nirS</em> gene has been described by Zennaro et al.Â (1993),<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-zennaro_nitrite_1993" role="doc-biblioref">215</a></sup></span> who inactivated the <em>nirS</em> gene in <em>Ps. aeruginosa</em> using a tetracycline cassette and then complemented the mutants with the wild-type gene on a plasmid. This met with some success and is discussed further in Chapter 6.</p>
<p>In all cases where semi-apo cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> is produced, it has proved possible to obtain holoprotein by reconstitution with purified haem <em>d</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span>. This has been performed for <em>Ps. aeruginosa</em><span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-silvestrini_expression_1992" role="doc-biblioref">268</a></sup></span> and <em>Ps. stutzeri</em> Zobell.<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-glockner_copper-containing_1993" role="doc-biblioref">63</a></sup></span> It is also possible to remove haem <em>d</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> chemically from the purified native holoprotein and reconstitute the semi-apo enzyme prepared in this manner to recover most of the activity; this has been described for cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> from <em>Ps. aeruginosa</em><span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-hill_reconstitution_1978" role="doc-biblioref">118</a></sup></span> and <em>Ps. stutzeri</em> M300.<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-weeg-aerssens_purification_1991" role="doc-biblioref">251</a></sup></span></p>
<p>This chapter describes a series of experiments carried out to express cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> from <em>T. pantotropha</em> in <em>E. coli</em>. First, mapping of the <em>nir</em> gene locus, which was performed to identify a suitable fragment that contained the full-length <em>nirS</em> gene for sub-cloning, is discussed. Cloning of the <em>nirS</em> gene into a broad-host range vector is then described. Expression of the gene in <em>E. coli</em> under aerobic and anaerobic conditions is analysed. The final section describes the partial purification of the expressed semi-apo cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> and a first attempt to reconstitute this material with purified haem <em>d</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span>. Throughout the chapter comparisons with the results of similar experiments from other laboratories are made.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.1</span> Sub-cloning of the full-length <em>nirS</em> gene from <em>T. pantotropha</em></h3>
<p>The <em>T. pantotropha</em> <em>nirS</em> gene was cloned initially as a set of four overlapping PCR products for sequencing (Chapter 3). For further work, a full length copy of the gene was required. In theory this could be produced by PCR using primers flanking the 5â- and 3â ends of the gene. PCR reactions using such primers (460F, nirSF, CT3R and nirS2R, Table 3.1, Chapter 3) were performed and appeared to produce fragments of the expected lengths (results not shown). However, extreme difficulty was experienced when attempting to clone the full length products. A large number of remedies were tried, including proteinase K treatment of the PCR products,<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-hitti_proteinase_1994" role="doc-biblioref">270</a></sup></span> the use of TA cloning vectors and different methods of PCR product purification, but none of the putative clones obtained after blue-white selection contained the desired insert when analysed by restriction mapping. In all cases, it appeared that rearrangement of the DNA had occurred. At present, the best explanation for this is that a recurrent error during synthesis of the longer PCR products prevented successful cloning, perhaps because of the expression of a toxic product from the DNA.</p>
<p>It therefore became necessary to obtain a genomic clone of the <em>nirS</em> gene. Probing a cosmid library prepared from <em>T. pantotropha</em> genomic DNA by Southern blotting with a <em>nirS</em> gene probe (the MID1 PCR product, Figure 3.1, Chapter 3) failed to identify a positive clone. However, blots of total genomic DNA, digested with <em>PstI</em>, <em>NotI</em> and <em>DdeI</em>, gave single bands in the size range 4.5-6 kbp (results not shown). Attempts to clone these fragments were in progress, when a plasmid containing the <em>T. pantotropha</em> <em>nirS</em> gene was obtained from Thon de Boer, Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam. The plasmid, pTNIR3, contains the <em>nirS</em> gene on a 7.5 kbp <em>SphI</em> fragment cloned in the vector pGEM7zf(+).</p>
<p>Plasmid pTNIR3 was analysed by restriction mapping so as to determine the best way of generating a fragment containing the <em>nirS</em> gene for further work. Figure 4.1 shows a restriction map of pTNIR3 obtained using six enzymes.</p>

<p>This indicated that the 7.5 kbp insert could be conveniently cut into two fragments of 5.1 kbp and 2.4 kbp using <em>PstI</em> and <em>SphI</em>. These fragments were cloned into the pBS(-) plasmid and the ends of the inserts were sequenced using universal M13 primers.

<p>It contains a number of useful features, which are as follows: (1) A <em>tac</em> promoter, which is a strong hybrid promoter constructed from the <em>trp</em> and <em>lac</em> promoters<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-de_boer_tac_1983" role="doc-biblioref">233</a></sup></span> for driving transcription, (2) the mp18 multiple cloning site which is compatible with the pBS(-) plasmid, in two possible orientations (these are designated pMMB67EH and HE), (3) a transcriptional terminator, derived from the <em>rrnB</em> gene, (4) the <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>-lactamase gene conferring ampicillin resistance, (5) the <em>lacI</em><span class="math inline">\(^q\)</span> gene, encoding a mutant form of the <em>lacI</em> repressor<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-gronenborn_overproduction_1976" role="doc-biblioref">272</a></sup></span> which is overproduced to prevent transcription in the absence of IPTG and (6) an origin of transfer, <em>oriT</em>, allowing transfer of the plasmid to other Gram-negative species by conjugation.<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-derbyshire_mobilization_1987" role="doc-biblioref">273</a></sup></span> This last feature allows the use of the same construct to investigate expression in other bacteria, which is described in Chapters 5 and 6.</p>
<p>In theory the 2.4 kbp <em>PstI-SphI</em> fragment derived from the plasmid pBNIR should be easily cloned into the mp18 cloning site of pMMB67EH. However, difficulty was experienced due to the problem of vector carryover as shown in Figure 4.4.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>This problem occurs when a fragment of similar size to the vector fragment is isolated from an agarose gel. A small amount of vector can be carried over with the desired fragment and, as pBS(-) is smaller than pMMB67EH, religation of the original plasmid occurs with higher efficiency producing clones containing the original vector. This is a particular problem when the two vectors contain the same antibiotic resistance determinant (in this case ampicillin). To circumvent this problem, a kanamycin resistance cassette was inserted in the <em>PstI</em> site of pBNIR to give the plasmid pBNIRK. The cassette and <em>nirS</em> gene were then isolated together as an <em>XbaI-SphI</em> fragment and cloned into pMMB67EH. This step introduces a new antibiotic resistance determinant and also increases the size of the insert by 1.2 kbp, thus improving its separation from the vector fragment. Several positive clones were selected by kanamycin resistance. The isolated plasmid, pMMBSEK, was then cut with <em>PstI</em> and subjected to partial religation to remove the kanamycin cassette. Cells of <em>E. coli</em> JM83 were re-transformed and ampicillin resistant clones were streaked onto plates containing either ampicillin or ampicillin plus kanamycin. Kanamycin sensitive clones, which had lost the cassette, were re-isolated and the construct was confirmed by restriction digests (Figure 4.5).</p>

<p>In order to obtain a complete analysis of expression from the <em>nirS</em> gene in <em>E. coli</em> JM83, cells of wild-type <em>E. coli</em> JM83, <em>E. coli</em> JM83 [pMMB67EH], <em>E. coli</em> JM83 [pMMBSEK] and <em>E. coli</em> JM83 [pMMBSE] were grown under both aerobic (in LB medium) anaerobic (minimal medium containing fumarate plus nitrite) conditions. Additionally, cultures of <em>E. coli</em> JM83 [pMMBSEK] and <em>E. coli</em> [pMMBSE] were induced with 1 mM IPTG during the early exponential phase of growth to activate transcription from the <em>tac</em> promoter. Twelve different cultures were grown as outlined in Table 4.2.</p>

<p>Reliable growth curves were not obtained for the anaerobic cultures, because in the cultures containing the <em>nirS</em> gene the cells tended to sediment and adhere quite strongly to the lower wall of the culture tube. The cells could be resuspended by vigorous vortexing, but this was avoided to maintain anaerobic conditions in the tubes. Instead, anaerobic cultures were vortexed once after 12 hours to ascertain that they had entered early exponential phase. At this point, cultures containing <em>E. coli</em> [pMMBSE] and E. coli [pMMBSEK] were induced with 1 mM IPTG and the cultures were left overnight for a total of 24 hours. Comparison with the early growth curve of the anaerobic culture of <em>E. coli</em> [pMMB67EH] indicated that this growth period was sufficient to reach stationary phase without over-growth (Figure 4.7).</p>

As no cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> was expressed from plasmid pMMBSEK (Figure 4.9), this effect seems likely to result from the stress of countering the antibiotic. Thus it is concluded that, aerobically, the <em>nirS</em> gene exerts no toxic effects on <em>E. coli</em> JM83.</p>
<p>Under anaerobic conditions, a greater disparity was observed between cultures of <em>E. coli</em> when compared with cultures carrying the different plasmids. Cells carrying the parent plasmid pMMB67EH, selected by ampicillin resistance, showed a pronounced lag when compared to the wild-type strain, taking around 24 hours to reach stationary phase as compared to around 16 hours for the wild-type (Figure 4.7) and the final optical density reached was slightly lower. This again suggests that the combined stresses of growing anaerobically in the minimal medium and countering the effects of the antibiotic acted together to slow the growth of the cells. Optical densities of cultures containing anaerobically grown <em>E. coli</em> [pMMBSE] and <em>E. coli</em> [pMMBSEK] could not be accurately determined because the cells in these cultures tended to sediment and adhere strongly to the walls of the tube. However, the final density of these cultures did appear to be somewhat lower than that of <em>E. coli</em> [pMMB67EH] grown anaerobically. The reduced growth rate and adherence to the walls of the tube occurred in <em>E. coli</em> [pMMBSE] and <em>E. coli</em> [pMMBSEK] irrespective of the presence of IPTG and so do not appear to be a consequence of expression of the <em>nirS</em> gene. It seems that cells in the latter two cultures were experiencing stress arising from an as-yet unidentified factor. One possible cause might be expression of the truncated <em>nirE</em> gene during anaerobic growth. The first 648 bp (encoding 216 amino acids) of the <em>nirE</em> gene are present on the plasmids pMMBSE and pMMBSEK and it is possible that the truncated gene product is toxic to the cells. Plasmids containing the upstream region of the <em>nirE</em> gene have also been observed to reduce yields of cells and DNA during routine cloning procedures in <em>E. coli</em> (Dr.Â Simon Baker, personal communication).</p>
<p>A Western blot of extracts from cells grown under various conditions (Figure 4.9) showed that cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> was expressed only from pMMBSE when induced using IPTG. No cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> was detectable without induction, indicating that the endogenous <em>nirS</em> promoter is not functional in <em>E. coli</em> under either aerobic or anaerobic conditions. Further evidence for this assertion is supplied by strains carrying the plasmid pMMBSEK, a construct where a kanamycin cassette lies between the <em>tac</em> promoter and the NNR box. In this construct, transcription from the kanamycin gene promoter would be expected to interfere with transcription from the upstream <em>tac</em> promoter, but not with the downstream endogenous promoter region, were it to be active. This assumes that the NNR box and downstream regions contain all the necessary information for transcriptional activation of the <em>nirS</em> gene; Chapter 7 discusses the region in more detail, but by analogy to FNR-activated genes it is believed that the above assumption is true. In cultures of <em>E. coli</em> [pMMBSEK] no expression was observed under any growth condition, even when induced with IPTG.</p>
<p>Under anaerobic growth conditions expression of cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> in <em>E. coli</em> was enhanced, as judged by Western blotting. <em>E. coli</em> has only been shown quite recently to synthesise a range of previously uncharacterised <em>c</em>-type cytochromes and it has been demonstrated that these are most abundant during anaerobic growth.<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-iobbi-nivol_reassessment_1994" role="doc-biblioref">269</a></sup></span> In the case of the endogenous <em>c</em>-type cytochromes the increase under anaerobic growth conditions is the result of several factors, including activation by FNR and other transcriptional activators, such as the NarX/L family.<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-darwin_nitrate_1995" role="doc-biblioref">274</a></sup></span> However, for cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> these factors are unlikely to be operative as the cloned fragment contains only the NNR box, which is probably not recognised by the <em>E. coli</em> FNR protein.<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-spiro_fnr_1994" role="doc-biblioref">186</a></sup></span> The increased amounts of cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> under anaerobic growth conditions are due in large part to the increased expression levels of the cytochrome <em>c</em> biogenesis genes under these conditions.<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-thony-meyer_escherichia_1995" role="doc-biblioref">275</a></sup></span> The amount of covalently-attached <em>c</em> haem increased in parallel with the increased levels of cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> polypeptide under anaerobic conditions (Figure 4.10), indicating that haem supply is increased anaerobically in <em>E. coli</em>. Previous studies have shown that expression of the <em>hemA</em> gene in <em>E. coli</em>, which encodes glutamyl-tRNA dehydrogenase, a haem precursor biosynthetic enzyme, is enhanced 2.5-fold under anaerobic as compared to aerobic growth conditions.<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-darie_effect_1994" role="doc-biblioref">276</a></sup></span> It has also been demonstrated that expression of cytochrome b<span class="math inline">\(_5\)</span> in <em>E. coli</em> provides a âhaem sink,â which increases the cellular haem content,<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-woodard_regulation_1995" role="doc-biblioref">277</a></sup></span> and a similar effect may result from cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> expression.</p>
<p>Western blotting and protein staining of the protein extracts showed that the expressed cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> was the same size as native cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> from <em>T. pantotropha</em> (Figures 4.8, 4.9). This indicates that the targeting sequence was recognised by the periplasmic export complex of <em>E. coli</em> and efficiently cleaved. It also suggests that the protein is exported to the periplasm. The fact that <em>c</em>-type haem is covalently attached also suggests correct targeting, as attachment of <em>c</em>-type haem is believed to take place in the periplasm.<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-page_apo_1990" role="doc-biblioref">278</a></sup></span> Thus it appears that recognition of the foreign <em>c</em>-type haem attachment site, processing and export to the periplasm can all occur in <em>E. coli</em>, implying that the steps are fundamentally similar to those in <em>P. denitrificans</em> and other Gram-negative bacteria. Similar observations have been made for other <em>c</em>-type cytochromes although the presence or absence of the <em>c</em>-type haem seems to depend very much on the particular protein. Examples of <em>c</em>-type cytochromes that have been successfully expressed as the holoprotein in <em>E. coli</em> include cytochrome <em>c</em><span class="math inline">\(_2\)</span> from <em>Rhodobacter sphaeroides</em>,<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-grisshammer_expression_1991" role="doc-biblioref">279</a></sup></span> though not the same protein from <em>R. viridis</em>, cytochrome <em>c</em><span class="math inline">\(_{550}\)</span> from <em>P. denitrificans</em>,<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-sambongi_alteration_1996" role="doc-biblioref">280</a></sup></span> cytochrome <em>c</em><span class="math inline">\(_{553}\)</span><span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-pollock_aerobic_1994" role="doc-biblioref">281</a></sup></span> and DcrA<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-fu_dcra_1994" role="doc-biblioref">282</a></sup></span> from <em>Desulfovibrio vulgaris</em>, mitochondrial cytochrome <em>c</em> from <em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em><span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-sambongi_alteration_1996" role="doc-biblioref">280</a></sup></span> and cytochrome <em>c</em><span class="math inline">\(_{550}\)</span> from <em>Thiobacillus versutus</em>.<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-ubbink_cytochrome_1992" role="doc-biblioref">283</a></sup></span> The optimal growth conditions also seem to be specific to each case; cytochrome <em>c</em><span class="math inline">\(_2\)</span> required anaerobic growth, whilst <em>T. versutus</em> cytochrome <em>c</em><span class="math inline">\(_550\)</span> was optimally expressed semi-anaerobically and the <em>D. vulgaris</em> cytochrome was optimally expressed under aerobic growth conditions. These observations have led to the suggestion that successful covalent haem attachment in <em>E. coli</em> may depend on the physical properties of the apoprotein. Anomalously, cytochrome <em>c</em><span class="math inline">\(_{552}\)</span> from the thermophilic bacterium <em>Hydrogenobacter thermophilus</em> can apparently attach <em>c</em>-type haem in the cytoplasm of <em>E. coli</em>, as demonstrated using expression from a gene in which the periplasmic targeting sequence has been deleted.<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-sambongi_synthesis_1994" role="doc-biblioref">284</a></sup></span> This is believed to result from spontaneous covalent attachment to the apoprotein, which possesses a highly ordered structure due to its thermostability.</p>
<p>Heterologous expression of <em>c</em>-type cytochromes is thus similar to that of other metalloproteins which have been expressed in <em>E. coli</em>, in that the complexity of the both the protein and its endogenous biosynthetic pathway both come to bear on the ease of expression. To give some examples, a number of proteins possessing the molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide cofactor (found in the dissimilatory nitrate reductases) have been successfully expressed,<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-garrett_molecular_1994" role="doc-biblioref">285</a></sup></span> as <em>E. coli</em> possesses several enzymes that contain the cofactor (and therefore the biosynthetic machinery to process such proteins) Iron-sulphur proteins have also been expressed relatively easily,<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-vidakovic_expression_1996" role="doc-biblioref">286</a></sup></span> as have simple copper proteins such as pseudoazurin,<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-leung_pseudoazurin_1997" role="doc-biblioref">287</a></sup></span> but more complex copper proteins such as nitrous oxide reductase are expressed as the apoprotein<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-viebrock_molecular_1988" role="doc-biblioref">288</a></sup></span> because of the absence of endogenous accessory gene products.</p>
<p>A spectrum of the soluble extract from anaerobically grown <em>E. coli</em> [pMMBSE] that had been induced using IPTG is shown in Figure 4.11. The quality of the spectrum was quite surprising, as it was very similar to that of pure semi-apo cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span>, suggesting that there was very little contamination by endogenous <em>c</em>-type cytochromes and that the expressed cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> was the major cytochrome <em>c</em> in the cells. In <em>E. coli</em> 712, a strain of <em>E. coli</em> that over-produces cytochromes <em>c</em>, five endogenous <em>c</em>-type cytochromes can be detected by haem staining after SDS-PAGE.<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-iobbi-nivol_reassessment_1994" role="doc-biblioref">269</a></sup></span> It appears that these cytochromes are less abundant in <em>E. coli</em> JM83, though a faint band corresponding to the <em>nrfA</em> gene product (a tetra- or possibly pentahaem nitrite reductase)<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-darwin_regulation_1993" role="doc-biblioref">289</a></sup></span> could be seen in some haem-stained extracts from <em>E. coli</em> [pMMBSE]. The expressed cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> shows the same characteristic absorption spectrum as the reduced chemically prepared form, with peaks at 416, 521, 548 and 554 nm, all originating from the <em>c</em>-haem, and the reversal relative to the holoprotein in the amplitude of the split peak at 548-554 nm noted in Chapter 3. Additionally, a peak can be seen at 317 nm. This peak is ascribed to low-spin reduced <em>c</em>-haem<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-barber_spectral_1976" role="doc-biblioref">290</a></sup></span> and cannot normally be seen in the chemically-prepared semi-apo protein, as the addition of reducing agents such as sodium dithionite masks absorbance in this region. The expressed cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> protein is reduced as isolated and remains stable in this form for several days at -20 Â°C. The same property and the 317 nm absorbance band have also been noted for the recombinant enzyme from <em>Ps. aeruginosa</em> when expressed in <em>Ps. putida</em>.<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-silvestrini_expression_1992" role="doc-biblioref">268</a></sup></span></p>
<p>When assayed with reduced methyl viologen, expressed semi-apo cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> is devoid of detectable nitrite reductase activity (Figure 4.15). This is unsurprising, as the <em>d</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> haem has previously been shown to be the site of this reaction,<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-silvestrini_reaction_1990" role="doc-biblioref">161</a></sup></span> although it has been reported that about 5% of the cytochrome <em>c</em> oxidase activity of native cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> can be restored to the chemically prepared semi-apo protein by reconstitution using <em>a</em>-type haem.<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-hill_reconstitution_1978" role="doc-biblioref">118</a></sup></span> However, in the case of the expressed protein in <em>E. coli</em> it seems that alternative haems are not inserted <em>in vivo</em>, as no activity was present and the only spectroscopic features were those of <em>c</em>-haem. In contrast to this result, Ohshima et al.Â (1993)<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-ohshima_cloning_1993" role="doc-biblioref">140</a></sup></span> reported that expression of the <em>nirS</em> gene from <em>P. denitrificans</em> IFO 12442 in <em>E. coli</em> gave measurable nitrite reductase and nitric oxide activities. However, the construct used in these experiments contained 10 kbp of downstream DNA in addition to the <em>nirS</em> gene and as the same downstream region in <em>P. denitrificans</em> PD1222 contains the genes for haem <em>d</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> biosynthesis,<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-de_boer_isolation_1994" role="doc-biblioref">141</a></sup></span> it may be that the same genes are present in <em>P. denitrificans</em> IFO 12242, thus allowing the formation of some active cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> in <em>E. coli</em>. The nitric oxide reductase activity is harder to explain, as the genes for this enzyme are upstream of the <em>nirS</em> gene in <em>P. denitrificans</em> PD1222<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-de_boer_mutational_1996" role="doc-biblioref">171</a></sup></span> (and in <em>T. pantotropha</em>, as shown by mapping the plasmid pTNIR3, Figure 4.2). It should be noted that the activities reported by Ohshima et al.Â (1993)<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-ohshima_cloning_1993" role="doc-biblioref">140</a></sup></span> are extremely low (in the order of units per gram of protein) and are barely above background level. Furthermore, the expressed protein was detected only by Western blotting and all work was performed with crude extracts, with no direct demonstration that holoprotein was formed (<em>e.g.</em> by partial purification and spectroscopy). The results of Ohshima et al.Â (1993)<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-ohshima_cloning_1993" role="doc-biblioref">140</a></sup></span> should therefore be viewed with some scepticism.</p>
<p>To reconstitute expressed cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> using haem <em>d</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> a soluble extract was prepared from 1 l of cells and partially purified on a small ion exchange column, using the same elution conditions as those employed during the purification of native cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span>. Figure 4.12 shows the elution profile from this column, which confirms that semi-apo cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span>, eluting at around 250 mM NaCl, was the major cytochrome <em>c</em> in the extract. SDS-PAGE of the peak fractions followed by staining for protein and haem showed the presence of a number of other proteins in the sample, although the expressed cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> was the only haem protein in the peak (data not shown). Further purification of the sample was not considered to be a sensible option because of the relatively low amounts of expressed protein obtained (about 1 mg from 1 l). Other groups have reported reconstitution of whole cell extracts,<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-glockner_copper-containing_1993" role="doc-biblioref">63</a></sup></span> so purity of the sample was not considered to be of paramount importance.</p>
<p>On mixing purified haem <em>d</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> and expressed cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> the pink colour was lost from the semi-apoprotein as the reduced <em>c</em>-haem was oxidised by the added haem <em>d</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span>. After removal of excess haem <em>d</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span>, the spectrum of the now oxidised protein was recorded (Figure 4.14a). The absorbance maxima were at similar positions to those in the native oxidised protein (407, 525 and 640 nm), although the peak at 407 nm was somewhat broader. The rise at around 640 nm due to the <em>d</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> haem was not as pronounced as that seen in the native enzyme, although there was clearly some absorption in this region. However, there was a clear shoulder at around 440 nm, indicative of absorption by the <em>d</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> haem.</p>
<p>The spectroscopic features became much clearer when the sample was reduced with sodium dithionite (Figure 4.14b). The double peak of the <em>c</em>-type haem was apparent, and the split peaks were of similar magnitude, which is indicative of holo cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span>. There was also a peak at around 625 nm and the shoulder at 440 nm moved to 460 nm and increased in size. All of these features indicate that at least some of the protein has bound the <em>d</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> haem to yield holoenzyme, with the 625 nm peak being shifted due to the binding of breakdown products from the sodium dithionite.<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-parr_reaction_1974" role="doc-biblioref">291</a></sup></span> However, the attenuated size of the 460 nm shoulder and 625 nm peak as compared to the native reduced protein (Figure 4.14c) suggests that not all of the enzyme has been reconstituted, and the spectrum is therefore a composite of the holo- and semi-apo forms.</p>
<p>The holo- and semi-apo forms of cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> can be further separated using ion exchange chromatography, as the holo- form is more negatively charged and so binds to a DEAE-Sepharose column more tightly. However, this step was not performed, again due to the low amounts of material obtained. The sample was assayed for nitrite reductase activity, using reduced methyl viologen as electron donor and a trace from this assay is shown in Figure 4.15. The reconstituted sample is clearly active as a nitrite reductase. Estimates of turnover number are quite difficult to obtain from this experiment, because the mixture of reconstituted holoprotein and remaining semi-apoprotein means that the amount of reconstituted material cannot be estimated spectrophotometrically, using previously determined extinction coefficients for cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span>. However, a rough calculation was made as follows. 50 <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>l of reconstituted material was assayed in a volume of 1 ml, and a methyl viologen oxidation rate of 0.109 <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>mol min<span class="math inline">\(^{-1}\)</span> was recorded. Assuming that the absorbance of the reduced semi-apoprotein is not greatly different at 548 nm to that of the holoprotein, the extinction coefficient at 548 nm is 48.95 mM<span class="math inline">\(^{-1}\)</span> cm<span class="math inline">\(^{-1}\)</span>, indicating that the material used in the 1 ml reconstitution reaction contained approximately 2.4 nmol of cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span>. As 50 <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>l of this (= 0.4 nmol) was used in the assay, the turnover number is 109/0.4 giving approximately 273 <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>mol of methyl viologen oxidised per minute per <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>mol of total cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> (<em>i.e.</em> reconstituted plus semi-apo protein). This is a similar figure to a typical assay of native cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> from <em>T. pantotropha</em>. However, as already noted the spectrum of the reconstituted material (Figure 4.14b) differs to that of the native protein, indicating that not all of the protein has been reconstituted. Table 4.3 shows the ratios of some of the peak absorbances of the semi-apo, reconstituted and native proteins in the reduced and oxidised states.</p>

<p>The figures indicate that the ratio of the Soret peak (the absorbance of which is contributed to by both <em>c</em> and <em>d</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> haems) to peaks composed primarily of absorbance from the <em>c</em> haem is lower by a factor of about two in the reconstituted protein compared to native cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span>. The spectroscopic features of the reduced reconstituted enzyme thus allow the crude estimate that the reconstitution was about 50% efficient.</p>
<p>A substantial amount of the maximum activity was, therefore, recovered following reconstitution of the expressed semi-apo enzyme, although it is considerably lower than that reported for reconstitutions of the chemically-prepared semi-apo enzyme from <em>Ps. aeruginosa</em><span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-hill_reconstitution_1978" role="doc-biblioref">118</a></sup></span> and <em>Ps. stutzeri</em> JM300,<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-weeg-aerssens_purification_1991" role="doc-biblioref">251</a></sup></span> in which almost 100% recovery was reported. There are a number of reasons why this might be the case. First, no attempt was made to optimise the procedure. Partial reconstitution of the recombinant semi-apoprotein was achieved quite easily in the present work, but attempts to reconstitute the chemically-prepared semi-apo cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> from <em>T. pantotropha</em> in this laboratory have proved to be technically challenging and success requires quite specific salt concentrations, buffer, haem <em>d</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span>:protein ratios and pH (A. KoppenhÃ¶fer, personal communication). It is probable that the procedure for reconstituting the recombinant semi-apo enzyme could be improved considerably by varying the conditions of the experiment. Secondly, the partial purity of the enzyme sample from <em>E. coli</em> may mean that some of the haem <em>d</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> bound non-specifically to other proteins and so was not available for reconstitution.</p>
<p>Bearing the above points in mind, it is concluded that expression in <em>E. coli</em> is a viable system for producing recombinant holo-cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> in the absence of an alternative system which can express the holoenzyme. The value of using <em>E. coli</em> is in the ability to express enzymically-inactive mutants of cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> which could then be reconstituted, as outlined in the introduction to this chapter. There are a few disadvantages to the approach, one of which is that large quantities of native cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> must be purified in order to extract haem <em>d</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> for reconstitution (though in the above experiments, relatively small quantities were used due to the scale of the experiment). A second problem is the possibility of heterogeneity between reconstituted samples which may make it difficult to interpret the results of some experiments, such as enzyme kinetics. This could probably be overcome to some extent by optimisation and standardisation of the procedure, though it is unlikely that reconstituted samples will be suitable for crystallisation unless the reconstitution is very uniform and efficient. The yield of expressed protein in the present work was quite low (around 1 mg l<span class="math inline">\(^{-1}\)</span>) and could probably be improved given time to optimise the conditions. Increased amounts of expressed protein would allow further purification of the sample, to reduce the possibility of non-specific binding of haem <em>d</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> outlined above. In the only other quantitative study of heterologous <em>nirS</em> expression, around 3 mg l<span class="math inline">\(^{-1}\)</span> of recombinant protein was obtained from cells of <em>Ps. putida</em>.<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-silvestrini_expression_1992" role="doc-biblioref">268</a></sup></span> Improvements in yield using the present construct may be achieved by varying the time of induction with IPTG or possibly varying the IPTG concentration. Investigation of expression levels in other strains of <em>E. coli</em> which overproduce <em>c</em>-type cytochromes, such as <em>E. coli</em> 7120 and its derivatives<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-darwin_regulation_1993" role="doc-biblioref">289</a></sup></span> might also be productive. The present construct, pMMBSE, is somewhat inconvenient; it would be better to try and clone only the <em>nirS</em> structural gene under the <em>tac</em> promoter, without the upstream region. This region contains an inverted repeat adjacent to the NNR box and removal of such structures has been demonstrated to improve in other cases.<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-yamamoto_blue_1987" role="doc-biblioref">292</a></sup></span> Removal of the truncated <em>nirE</em> gene may also be advantageous in view of the possible toxicity effects discussed previously. In addition to these experiments, a different vector system might be used. The pMMB67EH vector is quite large and cumbersome and several newer alternatives are now available, such as the pET vector systems,<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-studier_use_1990" role="doc-biblioref">293</a></sup></span> in which transcription is driven from a T7 RNA polymerase promoter, using modified <em>E. coli</em> strains that have the gene for this polymerase integrated into their genomic DNA. Figures for protein expression in the range of tens of milligrams per litre are frequently quoted for the latter system (though success always depends on the specific nature of the protein under investigation) and it would be of interest to investigate the expression of cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> in such a system.</p>

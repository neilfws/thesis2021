<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>In the previous two chapters, expression of the cloned <em>nirS</em> gene from <em>T. pantotropha</em> was investigated in the heterologous hosts
<em>E. coli</em> and <em>Ps. aeruginosa</em>. In each of these cases holo cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> could be obtained, either by reconstitution <em>in vitro</em> with haem <em>d</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> in the
former case or by expression under denitrifying conditions in the latter. It was seen that
neither of these approaches were ideal in terms of both the uniformity of the material
obtained and the difficulties in comparing the expressed material to the wild-type protein.
The experiments in this chapter therefore focus on a third possible expression system,
utilising a mutant of <em>T. pantotropha</em> in which part of the <em>nirS</em> gene has been deleted. Such
mutants would not synthesise cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> nitrite reductase and would not be expected to
grow well under anaerobic conditions, using nitrate as a terminal electron acceptor, because
the nitrite that would accumulate in the absence of cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> is toxic. In theory it
should be possible to complement the mutants using the <em>nirS</em> gene on a plasmid and restore
growth on nitrate. However, there are three possible problems to consider using this
approach: first, over-expression of the plasmid-borne <em>nirS</em> gene may interfere with the
normal regulation of denitrification in the cell (for instance by out-stripping the supply of
haem <em>d</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> to the polypeptide), second, disruption of the <em>nirS</em> gene may adversely affect <em>d</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span>
haem biosynthesis and third, expression of inactive mutants of cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> will not
restore growth on nitrate to the cells which will die because of the build-up of nitrite.</p>
<p>The experiments described in this chapter fall into three sections. In the first part the
construction of two mutagenic plasmids is described; these are used to insert a kanamycin
marker cassette upstream of the <em>nirS</em> gene and then to construct the unmarked deletion in the
gene itself. The second part of the chapter concentrates on the analysis of this mutant and its
complementation using the cloned <em>nirS</em> gene. Finally, in part three, attempts to express the
first site-directed mutant of cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> in which Tyr-25 is replaced with phenylalanine
are described.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.2.1</span> Construction of mutagenic plasmids and of the unmarked deletion mutant in the <em>nirS</em> gene</h3>
<p>The methods used to construct an unmarked deletion in the <em>nirS</em> gene of <em>T. pantotropha</em> were
developed by van Spanning (1991) <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-van_spanning_genes_1991" role="doc-biblioref">310</a>]</span>. To create the deletion two mutagenesis steps were used.
First, a kanamycin resistance marker was inserted upstream of the <em>nirS</em> gene cloned in the
suicide plasmid pGRPd1. The plasmid was then mobilised into <em>T. pantotropha</em> and cells in
which the marker had inserted into the chromosome by homologous recombination were
selected. This procedure is outlined in Figure 6.1.</p>

(a) Plasmid pGRPN3K (Table 6.1) is introduced into the cell and undergoes a single homologous recombination with the _nir_ region of the chromosome. (b) This results in a plasmid integrant strain which is both kanamycin- and spectinomycin resistant due to the spectinomycin resistance gene on the vector. (c) A second homologous recombination results in integration of the _kan_ gene upstream of the _nirS_ gene and loss of the spectinomycin resistance determinant on the suicide plasmid.

<p>In the second step, a copy of the <em>nirS</em> gene from which a fragment had been deleted was cloned into a second suicide plasmid,
pRVS1. This construct was then mobilised into the strain of <em>T. pantotropha</em> carrying the
kanamycin marker and cells in which the marker and the wild-type <em>nirS</em> gene were replaced
by the copy carrying the deletion were selected. This step is outlined in Figure 6.2.</p>

<p>To create this plasmid, a 1.2 kbp <em>PstI</em> fragment
containing the kanamycin resistance gene (<em>kan</em>) from the plasmid pUC4K <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-vieira_puc_1982" role="doc-biblioref">313</a>]</span> was isolated and ligated into the <em>PstI</em> site of the plasmid pTNIR3. The latter
site was located 27 bp upstream of the <em>nirS</em> NNR box. The new plasmid, designated
pTNIR3K, was digested with <em>SphI</em> to generate an 8.3 kbp fragment containing the <em>kan</em> gene
and having 5â- and 3â-ends in the <em>norB</em> and <em>nirE</em> genes respectively, as was described in
Chapter 4 (Figure 4.2). The <em>SphI</em> fragment was ligated into the <em>SphI</em> site of the suicide
plasmid pGRPd1, to give the final construct for use in insertional mutagenesis which was
designated pGRPN3K. The plasmid was analysed by restriction digestion to confirm that it
was the desired construct (Figure 6.4).</p>

<p><em>T. pantotropha</em> was transformed with <em>pGRPN3K</em> by conjugal transfer of the plasmid
from <em>E. coli</em> S17-1. The mated cells were harvested, serially diluted and plated on minimal
acetate medium containing 100 <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>g ml<span class="math inline">\(^{-1}\)</span> kanamycin and 1 mM PbNO<span class="math inline">\(_3\)</span> to select for <em>T. pantotropha</em> that had taken up the plasmid. 50 transconjugant colonies were picked from
these plates and streaked onto fresh minimal acetate medium containing 100 <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>g ml<span class="math inline">\(^{-1}\)</span>
kanamycin and onto identical plates that contained additionally 100 <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>g ml<span class="math inline">\(^{-1}\)</span> spectinomycin.
The selection step distinguished vector integrant strains arising from a single crossover
(phenotype Km<span class="math inline">\(^r\)</span>Sp<span class="math inline">\(^r\)</span>) from the desired insertion mutant strains which arose from a double
crossover (phenotype Km<span class="math inline">\(^r\)</span>Sp<span class="math inline">\(^s\)</span>). Fifteen of the latter type were identified, although each
streak was still contaminated to some degree with <em>E. coli</em> S17-1. To remove the
contaminants one of the streaks was picked with a sterile loop, diluted in LB medium and
lated on LB medium containing 100 <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>g ml<span class="math inline">\(^{-1}\)</span> kanamycin and 1 mM PbNO<span class="math inline">\(_3\)</span>. Four single
colonies were obtained from this plate and designated <em>T. pantotropha</em> K7-K10. The colonies
were confirmed as having the required Km<span class="math inline">\(^r\)</span>Sp<span class="math inline">\(^s\)</span> phenotype. To confirm correct insertion of
the kanamycin resistance marker into the chromosome, genomic DNA was isolated from <em>T. pantotropha K7</em>, digested with <em>HindIII</em> and probed by Southern blotting using the 1.2 kbp
fragment of pUC4K labelled with digoxigenin. Fragments of the expected sizes (4.8 and 1.1
kbp) were observed on the blot (Figure 6.5), confirming that the kan gene had inserted only
once in the expected site.</p>

<p>A 4.2 kbp <em>NotI</em> fragment containing the <em>nirS</em> gene and approximately 1.9 kbp
and 0.5 kbp of upstream and downstream DNA respectively was isolated from the plasmid
pTNIR3 and ligated into the <em>NotI</em> site of the plasmid pGEM5zf(+), giving a plasmid which
was designated pLN3N. pLN3N was digested using <em>BamHI</em> and <em>EcoRI</em> to remove an internal
fragment of 382 bp from the <em>nirS</em> gene. The fragment corresponded to amino acids 9 to 136
in the mature cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> polypeptide and included the haem ligands His-17 and Tyr-25.
The DNA fragment from which the 382 bp fragment had been removed was isolated, the
ends were blunted using T4 DNA polymerase and the plasmid was religated. The absence of
the 382 bp fragment was demonstrated with digests using the enzymes <em>PstI</em>, <em>NotI</em> and <em>SalI</em> (Figure 6.7).</p>

<p>These digests showed clearly that the plasmid had lost 382 bp and that a <em>SalI</em> site which lay between the <em>BamHI</em> and <em>EcoRI</em> sites was not present. The new plasmid with
the 382 bp deletion was named pLN3N<span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span>nir.
The <em>NotI</em> fragment of pLN3N<span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span>nir, now 3.8 kbp long, was isolated, the ends were
blunted using Sequenase (T7 DNA polymerase) and the fragment was ligated into the <em>SmaI</em>
site of the suicide vector pRVS1 to give the final construct for mutagenesis, designated
pRVS<span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span>nir. The presence of the insert was confirmed by digestion with <em>EcoRI</em>, <em>StyI</em> and <em>SalI</em>
(Figure 6.8) and by a PCR reaction using pRVS<span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span>nir as template DNA and the primers nirSF

<p><em>T. pantotropha</em> K7 was transformed with pRVS<span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span>nir by conjugal transfer from <em>E. coli</em>
S17-1 and transconjugants were selected initially on LB medium containing 100 <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>g ml<span class="math inline">\(^{-1}\)</span>
kanamycin, 100 <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>g ml<span class="math inline">\(^{-1}\)</span> spectinomycin and 40 <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>g ml<span class="math inline">\(^{-1}\)</span> X-Gal. These conditions selected for
vector integrant strains formed by a single crossover, the <em>lacZ</em> gene on the integrated plasmid
causing the colonies to be coloured pale blue. To promote the required double crossover
event, in which the vector together with the kanamycin resistance gene were excised and the
deletion was inserted into the chromosomal <em>nirS</em> gene, a single blue colony was inoculated
into 1.5 ml of LB medium that contained no antibiotics and grown aerobically overnight.
This culture was inoculated into fresh LB medium and grown again. The culture was then
serially diluted and plated on LB medium containing X-Gal at a concentration of 80 <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>g ml<span class="math inline">\(^{-1}\)</span>.
Most of the colonies obtained were vector integrants which formed small dark-blue colonies
on these plates. However, 25 white colonies were obtained and these were streaked onto
either LB medium, LB medium plus 100 <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>g ml<span class="math inline">\(^{-1}\)</span> kanamycin or LB medium plus 100 <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>g ml<span class="math inline">\(^{-1}\)</span>
spectinomycin. Of these, three exhibited the required white, Km<span class="math inline">\(^s\)</span>Sp<span class="math inline">\(^s\)</span> phenotype; they were
stocked and designated <em>T. pantotropha</em> <span class="math inline">\(\Delta5\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\Delta7\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Delta8\)</span>.
To confirm that the deletion in the chromosomal <em>nirS</em> gene was correct, genomic DNA
was prepared from wild-type T. pantotropha, <em>T. pantotropha</em> K7 and the three deletion
mutants, digested using <em>StyI</em> and probed by Southern blotting using a 141 bp fragment of the
<em>nirS</em> gene that had been labelled with digoxigenin by PCR. The Southern blot (Figure 6.10)
showed all of the expected hybridising fragments, confirming that the deletion mutants were
the desired ones.</p>

In the unmarked deletion mutants cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> should be absent, leading to a build

<p>Culture medium that contained wild-type <em>T. pantotropha</em> showed a steady rise in
nitrite concentration to a maximum of about 3 mM near the end of the exponential growth
phase, followed by a rapid decline to undetectable levels in under two hours. A similar
process was observed for <em>T. pantotropha</em> K7, although the maximum concentration of nitrite
reached was higher at 13 mM. In the unmarked deletion mutant nitrite concentration
continued to rise as growth slowed and reached a maximum of almost 20 mM, indicating
that almost all the nitrate originally present was converted to nitrite. The cells stopped
growing at about the time that maximum nitrite concentration was reached.</p>

<p>Once it had been demonstrated that the <em>nirS</em> deletion mutant could be complemented
successfully using pMMBSEK, the next step was to try to express a site-directed mutant of
cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> using the same system. The first such mutant to be tried was one in which
Tyr-25 was replaced with phenylalanine (Y25F). The role of this residue was discussed in
Chapter 3 and reasons for the choice of this mutant are discussed further in the next section.
The DNA fragment containing the Y25F mutant of cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> was constructed by
Dr.Â Simon Baker using the Promega Altered Sites II system. The mutagenic plasmid is

<p>First, a <em>BamHI</em> - <em>EcoRI</em> fragment was removed from pVA191-Y25F. This fragment carried the Y25F
mutation and was the same 382 bp of DNA that was removed from the <em>nirS</em> gene to construct
unmarked deletion mutants described in Section 6.2.1. The 382 bp fragment was ligated
into the plasmid pLN3N after first removing the equivalent fragment from the cloned <em>nirS</em>
gene in pLN3N and the new plasmid, designated pLN3NY25F was screened for the presence
of the new <em>MluI</em> site. The <em>nirS</em> gene containing the Y25F mutation was then cut from
pLN3NY25F as a 2.4 kbp <em>PstI</em> - <em>NotI</em> fragment and ligated into the vector pBluescript II
KS(+) which had been cut using the same enzymes. This construct was named pBY25F and
was analysed by restriction digestion and by partial sequencing using the 610F primer
(Chapter 3, Table 3.1) to confirm the cloning (Figure 6.18).</p>

<p>To construct an expression plasmid containing the <em>nirS</em> Y25F mutant gene, the 1.2 kbp <em>PstI</em> fragment from pUC4K

ligated into the broad host range vector pMMB67EH that had been cut with the same

<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.3</span> Discussion</h2>
<p>The method used to construct an unmarked deletion in the <em>nirS</em> gene of <em>T. pantotropha</em> has
been used previously in the closely-related organism <em>P. denitrificans</em> PD1222 to mutate a
number of genes including those encoding amicyanin <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-van_spanning_mutagenesis_1990" role="doc-biblioref">311</a>]</span>,
cytochrome <em>c</em><span class="math inline">\(_{551i}\)</span>, cytochrome c<span class="math inline">\(_{550}\)</span> and cytochrome c<span class="math inline">\(_{553i}\)</span> <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-van_spanning_method_1991" role="doc-biblioref">312</a>]</span>, the
cytochrome <em>c</em> oxidases <em>aa</em><span class="math inline">\(_3\)</span> and <em>cbb</em><span class="math inline">\(_3\)</span> <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-van_der_oost_reversed_1995" role="doc-biblioref">315</a>]</span> and the genes <em>moxJ</em> and
<em>moxG</em> which are involved in methanol oxidation <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-van_spanning_isolation_1991" role="doc-biblioref">316</a>]</span>. The method
has a number of advantages as compared to simple insertional mutagenesis using an
antibiotic resistance cassette; first, in-frame deletions can be constructed in order to prevent
polar effects on genes downstream of the mutated target gene and, second, the method allows
for the construction of multiple mutations by the repeated insertion of a kanamycin marker
into several targets followed by its replacement with the unmarked deletion. This is
especially important for <em>P. denitrificans</em> in which few selectable markers have been reported
<span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-steinrucke_genetics_1993" role="doc-biblioref">257</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>The first step of the mutagenic procedure, insertion of the kanamycin cassette into the
<em>PstI</em> site upstream of <em>nirS</em>, was accomplished quite easily. A large number of kanamycin
resistant transconjugants were selected after mating and 15 out of 100 of these proved to be
exconjugants when tested for spectinomycin susceptibility. This compares well with the
frequency of 40% reported for kanamycin insertion mutagenesis of the <em>cycA</em> gene in <em>P. denitrificans</em> <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-van_spanning_genes_1991" role="doc-biblioref">310</a>]</span>. The ease of this procedure was probably due in part to the extensive homologous regions each side of the kanamycin cassette in the mutagenic
plasmid pGRPN3K, in which there was approximately 5.1 kbp and 2.1 kbp of DNA
upstream and downstream respectively of the kanamycin cassette. It has been suggested that
at least 1 kb of homologous DNA each side of the insertion region is desirable for efficient
homologous recombination of both arms in <em>P. denitrificans</em> (Dr.Â Simon Baker, personal
communication). Southern blotting using the labelled kanamycin cassette showed clearly
that the fragment has inserted only once into the chromosome and the hybridisation of the
fragment to genomic DNA digested with <em>HindIII</em> indicated that the insertion was at the
correct site. This was confirmed by hybridisation of the labelled <em>nirS</em> gene fragment to DNA
digested using <em>StyI</em>, although in this experiment hybridisation to the larger of the two
expected fragments was very weak, probably due to the low region of overlap between the
large fragment and the small <em>nirS</em>-derived probe.</p>
<p>The second step of the method, replacement of the <em>nirS</em> gene and the kanamycin
marker by an unmarked mutation was somewhat more difficult to achieve. This was largely
due to difficulties experienced in ligating the blunted <em>NotI</em> fragment from pLN3N<span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span>nir into
the blunt-ended <em>SmaI</em> site of pRVS1. Eventually this cloning was achieved by blunting the
<em>NotI</em> ends using T7 DNA polymerase. Restriction analysis of the plasmid pRVS<span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span>nir was
complicated by the lack of a published restriction map for this plasmid and by the
observation that with certain enzymes (<em>e.g.</em> <em>PstI</em>) an anomalous restriction pattern was
observed in which the sizes of the fragments produced did not appear to add up to the total
size of the plasmid (11.6 kbp). However, the correctness of the construct was confirmed by a
combination of restriction and PCR analyses, and ultimately by Southern blotting of the
mutants obtained and their subsequent analysis. In future it would be advantageous to
engineer fragments for cloning into pRVS1 to have the appropriate restriction sites at their
termini and to have a detailed restriction map of the plasmid.</p>
<p>Replacement of the chromosomal <em>nirS</em> gene with the unmarked deletion also proved to
be quite challenging. To begin with, the procedure for selection of cells in which pRVS<span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span>nir
had become integrated into the chromosome proved to be slightly different to the published
protocol <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-van_spanning_genes_1991" role="doc-biblioref">310</a>]</span>, in that a concentration of 20 <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>g ml<span class="math inline">\(^{-1}\)</span> of X-Gal in the plates
was not sufficient to turn the colonies blue. At 40 <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>g ml<span class="math inline">\(^{-1}\)</span> the colonies were pale-blue.
However, the presence of spectinomycin and kanamycin, both at 100 <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>g ml<span class="math inline">\(^{-1}\)</span>, should have
been sufficient to detect plasmid integrant strains. In the next stage of the published protocol
cells are scraped from these plates, replated in the absence of antibiotics to promote excision
of the plasmid from the chromosome, then collected once more and plated in the presence of
a high X-Gal concentration to detect exconjugants, which colour white under these
conditions. In the case of <em>T. pantotropha</em> very few white colonies were obtained in this way,
and so a single colony was grown for two cycles in liquid culture to promote
recombinational excision of the plasmid. The number of white colonies obtained was
increased but was still very low; 25 were obtained after the second culture was diluted 10<span class="math inline">\(^7\)</span>
fold and plated on 10 plates, of which three colonies were kanamycin-sensitive and
contained the deletion. The frequency is somewhat lower than that reported for deletion
mutagenesis of the <em>cycA</em> gene in <em>P. denitrificans</em> (resolution frequency of 5 x 10<span class="math inline">\(^{-4}\)</span>, of which
25% were kanamycin-sensitive <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-van_spanning_genes_1991" role="doc-biblioref">310</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>Growth of the deletion mutant strains revealed the expected phenotype as compared
with the wild-type cells; in the absence of cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> the nitrite produced by nitrate
reductase activity accumulates rapidly to levels beyond which the cells no longer grow. It is
notable that the maximum nitrite concentration reached was practically equal to that of the
nitrate supplied originally in the medium, indicating that even if the cells are not growing
nitrate reductase activity is able to continue quite efficiently. The peak nitrite concentration
reached in cultures containing the kanamycin insertion was somewhat higher than in the
wild-type strain, indicating that nitrite reduction in this strain was impaired. On a Western
blot, slightly less cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> was observed in this mutant strain, and when harvested, the
cells were noticeably pink compared to the wild-type. The kanamycin insertion lies in the
promoter region of the <em>nirI</em> gene, which is known to be involved in the regulation of <em>nirS</em>
expression [de_boer_regulation_1996]. It is probable that in this mutant expression of <em>nirI</em> is impaired
but not abolished, allowing the formation of some active cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span>. The pink colour of
the cell pellet is possibly due to the expression of some semi-apo cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span>, which is
pink as it lacks the <em>d</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> haem, and/or to the attenuated level of holo-cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> which
normally colours the cell pellet brown.</p>
<p>Western blotting of the cell extracts from the deletion mutants showed that cytochrome
<em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> was absent, but revealed the presence of a new band with an approximate molecular
weight of 47 kDa. This band was specific to the deletion mutant and cells derived from it (it
was also observed in <em>T. pantotropha</em> <span class="math inline">\(\Delta7\)</span> carrying the plasmids pMMBSEK and pMMBY25F,
but not in the extracts from wild-type cells or from <em>T. pantotropha</em> K7). The most likely
explanation for this band is that it represents a truncated form of cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> generated
by the removal of the 382 bp <em>BamHI</em> - <em>EcoRI</em> fragment. During the latter procedure the
cohesive termini generated by restriction using these enzymes were filled in using T4 DNA
polymerase. Without sequencing across this junction it is not possible to know precisely
what junction was formed, as the polymerase may have removed some nucleotides from
either terminus as well as filling in the ends. However, analysis of the truncated gene using
the program SeqAid <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-roufa_seqaid_1989" role="doc-biblioref">317</a>]</span> indicates that the procedure may have
generated two new open reading frames. The first of these begins at the original ATG start
codon and is 264 bp long, encoding for 88 amino acids and is unlikely to be relevant. The
second begins at an ATG codon after the deletion and encodes a polypeptide of 429 amino
acids long (47.8 kDa) and this protein may be the species that is cross-reacting on the
Western blot. The presence of this polypeptide is not significant in terms of the later
complementation and mutagenesis experiments as it is unlikely to be periplasmic in the
absence of a targeting sequence, is clearly not active and does not contain the region in
which the Y25F mutation was made and so could not exchange this residue with the mutated
residue on plasmid pMMBY25F.</p>
<p>Complementation of the deletion mutant <em>T. pantotropha</em> <span class="math inline">\(\Delta7\)</span> using the plasmid
pMMBSEK was successful, as shown by the restoration of growth on nitrate and the
presence of the cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> polypeptide by Western blotting. The latter technique
showed that there was a significant, but not excessive, increase in the amount of expressed
protein from the plasmid as compared with the chromosomal copy of the gene, indicating
that the copy number is quite low in <em>T. pantotropha</em> as was discussed in Chapter 5. The
increased levels of cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> do not seem to have had a deleterious effect on the
regulation of denitrification in the cells as judged by analysis of the growth curves and of
nitrite levels in the culture medium, both of which were very similar to wild-type cultures.
pMMBSEK proved to be a good choice of plasmid for these experiments; it contains the
kanamycin resistance gene which is selectable in <em>T. pantotropha</em> and the upstream promoter
region which seems to be fully functional, removing the need for induction using IPTG. The
last point is important as the <em>tac</em> promoter is believed to function quite poorly in <em>P. denitrificans</em>
(Dr.Â M.L.D. Page and Dr.Â E. Gordon, personal communication).</p>
<p>Having demonstrated that the <em>nirS</em> deletion mutant could be complemented
successfully with a plasmid the next step was to try complementation using a site-directed
mutant of the <em>nirS</em> gene. The first mutant chosen was one in which Tyr-25 was mutated to
phenylalanine. The role of Tyr-25 was discussed in Chapter 3; it is a ligand to the <em>d</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> haem
in the oxidised enzyme structure and is postulated to displace nitric oxide from the haem iron
during the catalytic cycle of nitrite reduction <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-fulop_anatomy_1995" role="doc-biblioref">127</a>]</span>. This crucial role made
Tyr-25 an attractive candidate for mutagenesis. Phenylalanine was chosen as a replacement
residue as it has the same core structure as tyrosine, lacking only the hydroxyl group; the
latter feature would be expected to prevent bonding to the <em>d</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> haem iron. Additionally, Tyr-25
is located on the 382 bp <em>BamHI</em> - <em>EcoRI</em> fragment that was removed from the chromosomal <em>nirS</em> gene
to make the deletion mutant. This facilitated the construction of the mutant as the
same fragment could be inserted into the expression plasmid as a cassette and screened for
using the silent <em>MluI</em> restriction site. The absence of the residue in the chromosomal copy of
the gene also meant that it could not be transferred to the plasmid by homologous
recombination, although the probability of this kind of transfer is quite low and can always
be monitored by isolation of the plasmid from the cells and restriction analysis or
sequencing. One other possibility is that of reversion, in which the Y25F mutant of the <em>nirS</em>
gene might be transferred to the chromosome by homologous recombination and then
repaired by random mutation to give the wild-type gene. However, this is most unlikely as
the amount of homologous overlapping DNA between the plasmid and the chromosome is
quite low, especially at the 5â-end and, additionally, reversion is extremely rare in <em>P. denitrificans</em>
except under conditions of extreme selective pressure <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-steinrucke_genetics_1993" role="doc-biblioref">257</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>Growth of <em>T. pantotropha</em> <span class="math inline">\(\Delta7\)</span> [pMMBY25F) anaerobically on nitrate showed a
phenotype that was virtually identical to that of the deletion mutants, with poor growth and
an accumulation of nitrite to toxic levels. This was taken initially as evidence that the
expressed protein was not active. However, Western blotting showed that only very low
amounts of the protein were present. This might have been a consequence of the low yield
of cells (an ideal control experiment at this stage, although not possible in the present work,
would have been to compare the level of cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> to that in cells in which
denitrification was impaired due to another cause, such as mutations in other electron
transfer components), but the amount of cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> seemed abnormally low even taking
the poor growth into account. To investigate this further 20 l of cells were grown and partial
purification of cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> was attempted from a periplasmic extract. Despite several
trials no cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> was isolated from a DEAE-Sepharose ion-exchange column in
these experiments. By contrast the amounts of cytochrome <em>c</em><span class="math inline">\(_{550}\)</span> and cytochrome <em>c</em>â (proteins
that are normally observed during cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> purification) seemed to be close to or even
slightly higher than what would have been expected when taking into account the reduced
growth of the cells as compared to wild-type cultures. These results indicate that the Y25F
mutation resulted in a greatly attenuated level of expressed cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span>, perhaps as a
result of degradation of the protein. Unfortunately, this result does not allow a definite
conclusion as to whether Tyr-25 is essential for the enzymatic activity of cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span>,
since it was not possible to isolate sufficient quantities of the mutant enzyme for kinetic
analyses. However, as the mutant was expressed <em>in vivo</em> in <em>T. pantotropha</em>, it can be stated
that Tyr-25 is certainly a vital residue in some sense. One possible reason for the postulated
degradation could be that Tyr-25 plays an important structural role during assembly of the
enzyme. As well as ligating to the <em>d</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> haem iron, Tyr-25 is hydrogen-bonded via a water
molecule to the residues His-345 and His-388 in the oxidised structure of cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span>
<span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-baker_cytochrome_1997" role="doc-biblioref">262</a>]</span> and so is structurally important. It may be that some or all of the above
interactions are important during the assembly and folding of cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> <em>in vivo</em> and
that their absence in the Y25F mutant accounts for its degradation. However, an equally
valid argument is that the absence of enzymatic activity in the Y25F mutant leads to the
degradation of the enzyme as the cells experience increasingly non-physiological conditions
because of the accumulation of nitrite. Notably, Tyr-25 is disordered in the reduced structure
of cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span>, which is likely to be the physiologically-relevant form (Chapter 3) and so
at least some degree of complementation using pMMBY25F might have been expected, had
the Y25F mutant been active.</p>
<p>The growth of <em>T. pantotropha</em> <span class="math inline">\(\Delta7\)</span> [pMMBY25F] is essentially identical to that of the
deletion mutant alone and some interesting observations can be made concerning the
cytochrome content of the cells. First, a small <em>c</em>-type cytochrome was observed
(approximately 16 kDa on SDS-PAGE) which bound only weakly to the DEAE-Sepharose
column, stained poorly with Coomassie Blue and auto-oxidised following reduction using
sodium dithionite. This cytochrome has not been observed previously during purification of
cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> from wild-type cultures of <em>T. pantotropha</em> and its function is unknown. The
spectrum of the cytochrome did not correspond to any known published spectrum of <em>c</em>-type
cytochromes from <em>P. denitrificans</em> or other organisms, and so N-terminal sequencing would
be a useful first step in an attempt to identify this protein. It may be expressed as a
consequence of stress placed on the cells by the high nitrite concentration. Further evidence
that the mutant cells grown under these conditions are under some form of oxidative stress
was deduced from the elevated levels of cytochrome <em>c</em> peroxidase found in the cells.
Normally this protein is seen only as a small absorbance at 410 nm eluting just before
cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> from the DEAE-Sepharose column when wild-type cells are grown
anaerobically with nitrate. However, in the mutant culture cytochrome <em>c</em> peroxidase was the
major <em>c</em>-type cytochrome. It was also notable that elevated levels of the small blue copper
protein pseudoazurin were present, giving a blue colour to the fractions in which the protein
eluted that was clearly visible to the eye. Although the yield of pseudoazurin from wild-type
T. pantotropha has been reported as 0.6 mg l<span class="math inline">\(^{-1}\)</span> <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-moir_aspects_1993" role="doc-biblioref">238</a>]</span>, the protein has been
consistently difficult to detect during routine purification of cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> over the course
of the present work. The amounts observed in this case seem especially significant when the
poor cell yield is considered. This observation may indicate that pseudoazurin is produced in
response to oxidative stress and/or it may be an electron donor to cytochrome <em>c</em> peroxidase in
an analogous role to the similar protein azurin <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-ronnberg_reaction_1981" role="doc-biblioref">318</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>The complementation of the <em>nirS</em> deletion mutant using pMMBSEK has shown that
this is a viable expression system for cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span>, provided that the recombinant protein
is stable. Although the growth of the cells is poor the final optical density is still equivalent
to that of wild-type cells in early exponential phase and the yield of other cytochromes from
the ion-exchange column indicates that enough cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> could be obtained for further
studies, provided that it was not degraded. It may also be possible to increase the cell yield
by dialysis culture to remove the toxic nitrite produced or by simply growing larger culture
volumes. However, the potential instability of mutants such as Y25F presents a different
problem. As the mutant cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> could not be isolated from scaled-up cultures, it was
not possible to find out whether Tyr-25 was an essential residue for catalysis. This question
might be answered using the reconstitution of the expressed semi-apo protein from <em>E. coli</em>
that was described in Chapter 4. In this case the assembly of the protein differs to that <em>in vivo</em>, in that
it does not depend on the presence of Tyr-25 to ligand with the <em>d</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> haem during synthesis and folding
because the <em>d</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> haem is not present. It may therefore be possible to
insert the haem by reconstitution into semi-apo cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> Y25F and determine whether
the protein is catalytically active. The comments from Chapter 4 concerning improvements
to the expression system and standardisation of the reconstitution protocol are equally valid
here. Additionally, there are a large number of other potential targets for site-directed
mutagenesis that may still be tried using expression in <em>T pantotropha</em> <span class="math inline">\(\Delta7\)</span> or in <em>E. coli</em>.
These include His-17 which is the proximal ligand to the <em>c</em>-haem in the oxidised structure,
Met-106, the proximal <em>c</em>-haem ligand in the reduced structure and His-345 or His-388, which
are believed to act as proton donors during the dehydration of nitrite at the active site. The
first two of these lie in the 382 bp deleted region of the <em>nirS</em> gene and could be constructed in
much the same way as the Y25F mutant described in this chapter.</p>

For colorimetric detection, the membrane was incubated with 20 ml of colour solution (Section 2.5.22) in the dark without shaking until bands appeared. Development was stopped by washing with TE buffer. For chemiluminescent detection, the alkaline
phosphatase substrate CSPD (Boehringer Mannheim) was diluted 1:100 in 1 ml of substrate buffer and pipetted onto the membrane. Following a five minute incubation in the dark, excess solution was removed and the membrane was incubated in a sealed hybridisation bag at 37 Â°C for 15 minutes. The membrane was then exposed to X-ray film (Kodak), initially for one hour, until exposed bands appeared on the film.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.4.2.4</span> Primer extension analysis</h4>
<p>Primer extension was used to determine the 5â-end of the <em>nirS</em> gene mRNA transcript. The procedure was divided into 3 stages: oligonucleotide labelling, primer-RNA annealing and cDNA extension. 10 pmol of oligonucleotide was end-labelled in a 20 <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>l reaction containing kinase buffer (70 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 10 mM MgCl<span class="math inline">\(_2\)</span>, 5 mM DTT), 50 <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>Ci of <span class="math inline">\(\gamma^{32}\)</span>P-ATP and 8 units of polynucleotide kinase, exactly as described in Sambrook (1989). The labelled oligonucleotide was redissolved in 100 <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>l of TE buffer and could be stored at -20 Â°C for up to 1 week.</p>
<p>1 <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>l (approximately 109 cpm) of labelled primer was annealed to 40 <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>g of heat denatured RNA in 20 <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>l of annealing buffer (2 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.9, 250 mM KCl, 0.2 mM EDTA) at 50 Â°C for 90 minutes. The annealed primer-RNA was then ethanol-precipitated, redissolved in 20 <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>l of reverse transcription mix (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.3, 75 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl<span class="math inline">\(_2\)</span>, 10 mM DTT, 1.3 mM each dNTP, 20 units RNasin inhibitor, 50 <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>g ml<span class="math inline">\(^{-1}\)</span> actinomycin D, 33 units AMV reverse transcriptase) and incubated at 37 Â°C for 2 hours. DNA synthesis was stopped with 25 mM EDTA, pH 8.0. The mixture was treated with RNase at 37 Â°C for 20 minutes, extracted with phenol-chloroform, ethanol-precipitated and redissolved in 4 <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>l of TE buffer. 6 <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>l of sequencing stop solution was added and the labelled cDNA was run on a 6% acrylamide sequencing gel alongside a reference sequencing ladder generated using the same primer.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.4.2.5</span> 5â-RACE (Rapid amplification of cDNA 5â ends)</h4>
<p>5â-RACE was used as an alternative method to determine the 5â-end of mRNA transcripts. The procedure used closely followed that of Frohman (1993).<span class="citation"><sup><a href="#ref-frohman_rapid_1993" role="doc-biblioref">250</a></sup></span> 10 <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>g of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using the <em>nirS</em> sequence specific primer 284R (5â-GACATCCTGCTGCGCAAGGT-3â). The mixture was then diluted with TE buffer, excess primer and nucleotides were removed by centrifugation through a Centricon-100 filter and the cDNA was recovered on a Millipore spin filter in 10 <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>l of TE buffer. Addition of the poly-dATP tail and the two subsequent nested PCR amplifications were performed exactly as described by Frohman (1993), using the forward primers Q<span class="math inline">\(_T\)</span>, Q<span class="math inline">\(_0\)</span> and Q<span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> (detailed in Frohman, 1993) and the sequence specific reverse primers 242R (5â-ATAGTCGGTGCGCGTCTT-3â) and 228R (5P-TCTTGTGGTCCTCCAGCG-3â). PCR products were analysed by electrophoresis on 1.2% agarose gels, cloned into the pGEM-T vector and sequenced using M13 universal primers.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>Transposon mutagenesis and the use of heterologous gene probes have led to the
identification of gene clusters containing over thirty genes involved in denitrification in <em>Ps. stutzeri</em> Zobell, <em>Ps. aeruginosa</em> and <em>P. denitrificans</em> <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-zumft_enzyme_1997" role="doc-biblioref">167</a>]</span>. Some of these genes have been well characterised, in particular the structural genes that encode the
enzymes of denitrification and some of the accessory genes involved in their biosynthesis
such as those involved in the assembly of the <em>d</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> haem group in cytochrome <em>cd</em><span class="math inline">\(_1\)</span> <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-palmedo_resolution_1995" role="doc-biblioref">319</a>]</span>.
However, very little transcriptional analysis of denitrification gene operons has
been reported. Most of the work in this field has been performed in <em>Ps. stutzeri</em> Zobell. In
this organism, transcription start site analysis has been reported for the genes <em>fnrA</em> <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-cuypers_anaerobic_1993" role="doc-biblioref">204</a>]</span>, <em>norCB</em> <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-zumft_nitric_1994" role="doc-biblioref">320</a>]</span> and <em>nosZ</em> <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-cuypers_multiple_1995" role="doc-biblioref">219</a>]</span> and Northern blotting has been used to determine the major transcripts from these genes. Northern
blotting of transcripts from the <em>nirS</em> gene region has also been reported <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-zumft_diversity_1995" role="doc-biblioref">220</a>]</span>.
Similar analysis of the <em>nor</em> genes <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-bartnikas_characterization_1997" role="doc-biblioref">321</a>]</span> and the <em>nirK</em> gene which encodes a
copper nitrite reductase <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-tosques_characterization_1997" role="doc-biblioref">322</a>]</span> have been performed using <em>Rhodobacter sphaeroides</em>.
In other cases sequence analysis has been employed, as in the <em>nir</em> operon of <em>Ps. aeruginosa</em> <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-kawasaki_gene_1997" role="doc-biblioref">221</a>]</span>
to look for transcription terminator features that might indicate the size of gene transcripts. In <em>P. denitrificans</em> transcriptional analysis is very much
in its infancy; very few genes have had their transcription start sites determined and little is
known about the promoter regions of any gene family. More experimental data from <em>P. denitrificans</em> would be extremely valuable as much of the regulation of denitrification is
likely to occur at the level of transcription. Identification of promoters and the proteins that
interact with them could improve our understanding of how denitrifying organisms sense
environmental factors such as oxygen tension and nitrate concentration and co-ordinate the
expression of the many genes involved in denitrification.</p>
<p>The experiments described in this chapter had two objectives: first to measure the
size of the transcript from the <em>nirS</em> gene and second, to determine the transcription start site
using two different methods. Following discussion of the results an analysis of NNR
dependent genes is presented with the aim of discussing some of the possible ways in which
the transcription of the <em>nirS</em> gene may be regulated. Finally, some ideas for future
experiments in this area are discussed.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.2</span> Results</h2>
<p>The starting material for the experiments described in this chapter was total RNA extracted
from <em>T. pantotropha</em> that had been grown anaerobically to mid-exponential phase. The
extraction method was based on a number of methods rather than on one specific protocol;
cell lysis under denaturing conditions and phenol-chloroform extraction was based on the
method of Chattopadhyay <em>et al</em>. (1993) <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-chattopadhyay_inexpensive_1993" role="doc-biblioref">247</a>]</span>. A 50 ml culture typically yielded 150-200 <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>g of
total RNA with a ratio of absorbances at A<span class="math inline">\(_{260}\)</span>:A<span class="math inline">\(_{280}\)</span> of 1.5-1.9, which is considered to be of
sufficient quality for further work <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-chirgwin_isolation_1979" role="doc-biblioref">323</a>]</span>. The extracted total RNA was
separated using denaturing formaldehyde agarose gel electrophoresis to determine whether
degradation had occurred during the extraction procedure. Figure 7.1 shows a gel containing
a sample of RNA from <em>T. pantotropha</em> that has been run alongside a total RNA extract from
<em>Escherichia coli</em> (prepared in the same way as that from T. pantotropha) and a sample of
total RNA from human cells (obtained from Dr.Â Stuart Wilson, University of Oxford).</p>

<p>Under these conditions two bright bands of ribosomal RNA and a faint smear of messenger
RNA should be observed. In the case of <em>E. coli</em> the 23S and 16S ribosomal RNA molecules
are 2904 <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-brosius_complete_1980" role="doc-biblioref">325</a>]</span> and 1541 nucleotides long <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-brosius_complete_1978" role="doc-biblioref">326</a>]</span>, respectively.
Undegraded RNA should exhibit a 2:1 staining ratio for the 23S and 16S rRNA species
<span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-chirgwin_isolation_1979" role="doc-biblioref">323</a>]</span>. The sample from <em>T. pantotropha</em> contained two strongly-staining
bands of RNA, but the upper band ran with the same mobility as the 16S RNA species
whereas the lower band was smaller, with an estimated size of approximately 900 bases.
This result is discussed further in the following section, but it results from the fragmentation
of the 23S rRNA molecule and in this case does not indicate that the RNA is degraded.</p>
<p>The length of the <em>nirS</em> transcript was determined using Northern blotting. For this
experiment 5, 10 and 20 <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>g samples of total RNA from <em>T. pantotropha</em> were separated by
electrophoresis on a 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to a positively charged
nylon membrane by capillary transfer using 20x SSC. The lane containing RNA size
standards was removed from the blot and stained using methylene blue. The transferred
RNA was then hybridised with a DNA probe of 141 bp in length, which had been generated
from <em>T. pantotropha</em> genomic DNA using a PCR reaction with the primers nirSF and 228R
(Table 3.1, Chapter 3). The probe was labelled with dUTP-digoxigenin-alkaline phosphatase
conjugate. Following hybridisation and washing, the hybridised probe was visualised
colorimetrically using a stain for the conjugated alkaline phosphatase activity (Figure 7.2).</p>

<p>In all lanes a single band with an approximate size of 1.85 kb was detected. Northern
blotting was also performed using chemiluminescent detection of the probe with the alkaline
phosphatase substrate CSPD. This technique is several times more sensitive than the
colorimetric detection method and was used to look for minor transcripts of different sizes.
However, only the same 1.85 kb band was detected in these experiments (Figure 7.3).</p>

these experiments (results not shown).</p>
<p>A primer extension experiment was performed using a sample of <em>T. pantotropha</em>
RNA in order to determine the transcription start point of the mRNA transcribed from the

were homologous to the reverse strand of the early region of the <em>nirS</em> gene (Figure 7.4).</p>

<p>The specificity of the oligonucleotides was analysed using PCR reactions with genomic DNA
from <em>T. pantotropha</em> and the nirSF primer (Chapter 3, Table 3.1), which gave specific
products of 197, 155 and 141 bp respectively (not shown). Early trials of the primer
extension experiment indicated that the 228R primer was most specific for annealing to
mRNA and so this primer was chosen for further work.</p>
<p>The 228R primer was labelled at the 5â-end with <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>-<span class="math inline">\(^{32}\)</span>P-ATP and approximately 10<span class="math inline">\(^5\)</span>
cpm of labelled primer was annealed to 40 <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>g of total RNA from <em>T. pantotropha</em>. Avian
myeloblastosis virus (AMV) reverse transcriptase was then used to synthesise a cDNA
extending from the labelled primer to the 5â-end of the <em>nirS</em> mRNA molecule (the 3â-end of
the cDNA). The labelled cDNA was recovered by organic extraction and precipitation. It
was then electrophoresed on a standard 6% acrylamide sequencing gel alongside a
sequencing ladder generated using the 228R primer and the plasmid pTNIR3 (Chapter
4 Figure 4.2) as template DNA. The relevant portion of this gel is shown in Figure 7.5.</p>

<p>The sequencing reactions were not of high quality in this case and it was not possible to replicate
the reactions before the activity of the labelled cDNA had reached unusable levels.
However, it was clear that the labelled cDNA product ran with the same mobility as a
guanine residue, 29 residues upstream of the <em>nirS</em> ATG start codon on the sequencing ladder.
The NNR-binding site upstream of the <em>nirS</em> gene was also clearly visible on the sequencing
gel and as the segment of DNA has been sequenced many times previously during
sequencing of the <em>nirS</em> gene, it was possible to assign confidently a transcription start site for
the <em>nirS</em> mRNA, as shown in Figure 7.6.</p>

<p>As in the primer extension, experiment an oligonucleotide (R1) is
first annealed to the specific mRNA and a cDNA is synthesised, the 3â-end of which
corresponds to the 5â-end of the mRNA transcript. A tail of dATP residues is then added to
the 3â-end of the cDNA using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. This allows a set of
nested PCR reactions to be performed, using three forward primers (QTF, QOF and Q1F <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-frohman_rapid_1993" role="doc-biblioref">250</a>]</span>)
and two further reverse primers, R2 and R3. The PCR product so generated
can be cloned and sequenced conventionally and the 5â-end of the mRNA corresponds to the
first residue seen after the poly-dATP tail on the sequencing ladder.</p>
<p>In the 5â-RACE experiment the primer 284R was annealed to <em>nirS</em> mRNA and
extended using Moloney murine leukaemia virus (MMLV) reverse transcriptase to generate
cDNA. Following initial PCR amplification using the QTF primer and 284R, nested PCR
reactions were carried out using first QOF plus 242R and then Q1F plus 228R An aliquot of
the last PCR reaction was electrophoresed on a 1.4% agarose gel (Figure 7.8).</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.3</span> Discussion</h2>
<p>Isolation of prokaryotic RNA can be technically challenging due to the short half-life of
bacterial mRNA (typically 1-2 minutes <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-runar_ra_characterization_1995" role="doc-biblioref">327</a>]</span>) and the problem of
contamination with both endogenous and exogenous RNases. The quality of isolated RNA
is determined by two main measurements: a ratio of absorbances at 260 and 280 nm of 1.7
2.0 and a 23S:16S rRNA intensity ratio of 2:1 when stained with ethidium bromide after
denaturing gel electrophoresis. Total RNA isolated from <em>T. pantotropha</em> contained two
major bands that stained with ethidium bromide in a 2:1 ratio, but comparison with RNA
from <em>E. coli</em> showed that the 23S rRNA band was largely absent in these samples, having
apparently degraded to a 16S rRNA sized species and a smaller species. However this is not
indicative of general degradation in the RNA samples. Specific degradation of the 23S
RNA molecule has been observed during RNA isolation from the bacterium <em>Rhodobacter capsulatus</em> <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-yu_molecular_1982" role="doc-biblioref">328</a>]</span>,
an organism that is very closely related to <em>T. pantotropha</em>. In the latter case it was demonstrated that intact 23S rRNA could be isolated using sucrose
density gradient centrifugation and the conditions of gel electrophoresis (in particular a low
concentration of divalent cations) were responsible for the observed degradation.
Fragmentation of the 23S rRNA molecule has also been observed in <em>Rhodospirillum rubrum</em>
<span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-chow_properties_1976" role="doc-biblioref">329</a>]</span>, <em>Rhodobacter sphaeroides</em> <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-marrs_23_1970" role="doc-biblioref">330</a>]</span> and <em>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</em> <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-grienenberger_structure_1975" role="doc-biblioref">331</a>]</span>.
In the latter case degradation of the 23S rRNA is proposed to occur <em>in vivo</em> during maturation of the ribosome. Thus it is clear that
23S rRNA degradation is common to several members of the <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>-Proteobacteria, including
species that are closely related to <em>T. pantotropha</em>. The positive results of the experiments
described in this chapter also show that the <em>nirS</em> mRNA that was isolated cannot have been
severely degraded.</p>
<p>Northern blotting using a DNA probe for the <em>nirS</em> gene identified a single transcript
that was approximately 1.85 kb long. The coding region of the <em>nirS</em> gene is 1788 bp long
and in <em>P. denitrificans</em> PD1222 is followed by the genes <em>nirE</em> (864 bp), <em>nirC</em> (309 bp), <em>nirF</em>
(1155 bp) and <em>nirD</em> (645 bp) <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-de_boer_isolation_1994" role="doc-biblioref">141</a>]</span>. Preliminary sequencing and restriction
analysis of the <em>nir</em> locus in <em>T. pantotropha</em> indicates the presence of at least <em>nirE</em> and <em>nirC</em>.
The 1.85 kb mRNA species is therefore a <em>nirS</em> transcript. Knowledge of the <em>nirS</em> gene
transcription start site described later in this chapter allows an approximate placement of the
end of the <em>nirS</em> transcript between the <em>nirS</em> and <em>nirE</em> genes (Figure 7.11).</p>

</div>
<p>An imperfect inverted repeat 18 bp long (described in Chapter 3) lies between these two genes This
feature was originally annotated as an oxygen responsive element in the <em>P. denitrificans</em>
PD1222 <em>nir</em> locus, but it bears little resemblance to other ORE features and the annotation
has subsequently been withdrawn <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-de_boer_isolation_1994" role="doc-biblioref">141</a>]</span>. It seems more likely that the
inverted repeat is involved in terminating the transcription of the <em>nirS</em> gene. The GC-rich
region can form a stem-loop structure as shown in Figure 7.11 and together with an AT-rich
region downstream of the repeat, the structure is very similar to a <em>rho</em>-independent
termination site <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-farnham_model_1980" role="doc-biblioref">332</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>Transcription of the <em>nir</em> region in <em>T. pantotropha</em> thus appears to differ from that of
the <em>nir</em> genes in <em>Ps. stutzeri</em> Zobell and <em>Ps. aeruginosa</em>. In <em>Ps. stutzeri</em> Zobell two transcripts
containing either <em>nirS</em> or <em>nirS</em> plus <em>nirT</em> have been detected <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-zumft_diversity_1995" role="doc-biblioref">220</a>]</span>, whilst in <em>Ps. aeruginosa</em>
no transcript analysis has been performed to date, although analysis of the <em>nir</em> region suggests a large single transcript containing the genes <em>nirSMCFDLGHJEN</em> terminated
by a stem-loop structure <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-bartnikas_characterization_1997" role="doc-biblioref">321</a>]</span>. Chemiluminescent detection of the <em>nirS</em>

<span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-engler-blum_reduction_1993" role="doc-biblioref">249</a>]</span> failed to detect any longer transcripts from <em>T. pantotropha</em> in the
present work. However, it is still possible that longer transcripts including the <em>nirS</em> gene are
present <em>in vivo</em>; they may be present at only very low levels or, alternatively, very large
transcripts may not be efficiently transferred to the nylon membrane prior to hybridisation.
Transfer of large mRNA molecules can be improved by partial hydrolysis prior to blotting
<span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-sambrook_molecular_1989" role="doc-biblioref">235</a>]</span> and it would be of interest to repeat the experiment using this
technique. Northern blotting was attempted using a labelled DNA probe derived from parts
of the <em>nirE</em> and <em>nirC</em> gene but no transcript was detected. It may be that the transcript
containing these genes was not detectable for the reasons described above. Alternatively the
probe may not have been of sufficient quality; although the <em>nirS</em> gene probe efficiently
detected the <em>nirS</em> transcript, single-stranded RNA probes are preferred for Northern blotting
<span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-melton_efficient_1984" role="doc-biblioref">333</a>]</span>. In future experiments it would be valuable to synthesise riboprobes
from the <em>nir</em> genes for Northern blotting.</p>
<p>The transcription start site of the <em>nirS</em> gene was identified as a guanine residue 29 bp
upstream of the <em>nirS</em> ATG start codon. The sequencing ladder used in the primer extension
experiment was not of high quality, but as described in the results section assignment of the
start site was possible with prior knowledge of the <em>nirS</em> gene sequence in the relevant region.
Additionally, the independent method of 5â-RACE gave the same result for the start site.
The guanine residue is a good candidate for the authentic transcription start site as mRNA
transcripts most often begin with a G or an A residue <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-hawley_compilation_1983" role="doc-biblioref">334</a>]</span> and the
start site is -41.5 bp downstream of the centre of the NNR box. The spacing is the same as
that observed between the FNR-binding site and the transcription start site in <em>E. coli</em> genes
that are activated by FNR <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-eiglmeier_molecular_1989" role="doc-biblioref">335</a>]</span>. Once the transcription start site of the
<em>nirS</em> gene had been identified it was possible to look for upstream sequence features that
might be involved in transcriptional regulation. The first observation is that there are no
sequences which resemble the -10 and -35 hexamers seen upstream of sigma-70 dependent
genes from other species of bacteria, particularly <em>E. coli</em>. In <em>E. coli</em> these regions are well
characterised and consist of the consensus sequence TTGACA-N<span class="math inline">\(_{16-18}\)</span>-TATAAT, where the
TTGACA sequence is centred at -35 and the TATAAT sequence (or Pribnow box) is centred
at -10 from the transcription start site <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-hawley_compilation_1983" role="doc-biblioref">334</a>]</span>. The -35 and -10
sequences are involved in binding the <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^{70}\)</span> subunit of the RNA polymerase holoenzyme
<span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-siebenlist_e_1980" role="doc-biblioref">336</a>]</span>. There is evidence that <em>T. pantotropha</em> probably does contain a <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^{70}\)</span>
dependent RNA polymerase; a recent survey of genes from <em>P. denitrificans</em> and other <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>-Proteobacteria
in which the transcription start site is known has shown that a similar <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^{70}\)</span> consensus sequence can be discerned in some instances
<span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-baker_molecular_1998" role="doc-biblioref">337</a>]</span>.
Additionally, the gene <em>xylE</em> cloned in a broad host range vector under the control of the <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^{70}\)</span>-dependent
bacteriophage T4 gene 32 promoter was transcribed from an identical start site in a range of
Gram-negative bacteria, including <em>Paracoccus denitrificans</em> <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-frey_bacteriophage_1988" role="doc-biblioref">338</a>]</span>, suggesting a
common mechanism of <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^{70}\)</span> recognition. In the case of the <em>nirS</em> gene it might be expected
that the RNA polymerase binding sites differ from those normally found in <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^{70}\)</span> dependent
genes as the NNR-binding site overlays the -35 region and the NNR protein contains a
putative site for interaction with RNA polymerase <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-de_boer_regulation_1996" role="doc-biblioref">168</a>]</span>. However, due to the lack
of an obvious -10 site in the <em>nirS</em> gene it is concluded that transcription of the <em>nirS</em> gene is
probably independent of <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^{70}\)</span>. A less likely possibility is that the specificity of the <em>T. pantotropha</em> <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^{70}\)</span>
subunit differs from that of the E. coli <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^{70}\)</span> and can bind to a much weaker -10 consensus,
particularly when binding is enhanced by the NNR protein. Experiments in
<em>Ps. aeruginosa</em> using the ANR and FNR proteins indicated that the <em>Ps. aeruginosa</em> <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^{70}\)</span>-
dependent RNA polymerase may have different specificity from that of the <em>E. coli</em> enzyme
<span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-winteler_homologous_1996" role="doc-biblioref">203</a>]</span> and <em>in vitro</em> data also suggested that the purified polymerase may
be less stringent <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-gao_rna_1991" role="doc-biblioref">339</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>An alternative -10/-35 promoter consensus sequence was proposed by SteinrÃ¼cke and
Ludwig (1993) <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-steinrucke_genetics_1993" role="doc-biblioref">257</a>]</span>, based on the analysis of several genes from <em>P. denitrificans</em> and closely-
related species. This consensus was TTCGGN-N<span class="math inline">\(_{16-20}\)</span>-GATNGG/C. A match to this, with
four of the six positions filled in each hexamer can be discerned in the <em>nirS</em> upstream
sequence if it is assumed that as in <em>E. coli</em> the -10 site is allowed to fall anywhere in the first
hexamer. However, this consensus is now thought unlikely to be accurate as very little of the
data was based on experimentally determined transcription start sites for <em>P. denitrificans</em>
genes. Furthermore, genes that encoded proteins from a range of metabolic activities were
included in the analysis, with little consideration of whether the genes were expressed
constitutively or under specific conditions.</p>
<p>The last point is very important as in order to analyse the transcription of the <em>nirS</em>
gene in a meaningful manner, it should really be compared with the transcription of other
NNR-dependent (or possibly FNR-dependent) genes from <em>P. denitrificans</em> or its close
relatives. Unfortunately no information concerning transcripts from the <em>nir</em> or <em>nor</em> genes in
<em>P. denitrificans</em> is available apart from that reported in this chapter, as most work in the area
has been carried out using <em>Ps. stutzeri</em> Zobell. However, it was possible to examine the
sequences of the NNR-dependent genes <em>nirS</em> and <em>norCB</em> from <em>P. denitrificans</em> and <em>T. pantotropha</em>
by aligning the NNR-binding sites of these sequences and looking for common
features lying between the NNR-binding site and the ATG start codon (Figure 7.12).</p>

<p>The <em>nirI</em> genes from these organisms were also included in this analysis as they may be regulated
by NNR (see below). Several regions of homology between some or all of the sequences are
apparent from this alignment. First, the <em>nirS</em> genes contain a perfect inverted repeat of 10 bp
which begins five base pairs after the last nucleotide of the NNR-binding site. These repeats
were noted during the sequencing of the <em>nirS</em> gene described in Chapter 3. Less well-defined
repeats can be discerned in some of the other sequences, but the repeats in the <em>nirS</em> sequences
stand out because they are perfect and because of a striking structural conservation; the first
and last dinucleotides in the repeat from the <em>T. pantotropha</em> sequence are TT and AA
respectively whereas those in the two sequences from the <em>P. denitrificans</em> <em>nirS</em> genes are GG
and CC. Thus although the sequences differ, a perfect repeat is conserved in each case. This
feature suggests a structural role for the repeat. A possible role is in the binding of
a transcriptional repressor protein which would serve to prevent transcription of the <em>nirS</em> gene
under non-denitrifying conditions. Repeats of similar size and structure that serve to bind
repressors are common to many prokaryotic genes <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-schmitt_cloning_1994" role="doc-biblioref">340</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>The second striking feature in the upstream sequences is the presence of a
hexanucleotide with the sequence TTGCGC in the <em>nirI</em> and two of the <em>nirS</em> sequences.
sequence (TTGCCG) and in two sequences that are apparently not regulated by NNR: <em>nirE</em>
Similar sequences are seen in the <em>T. pantotropha</em> <em>nirS</em> gene sequence (TTCCGC), the <em>norCB</em>
(TTCGCG) and the <em>nnr</em> gene itself (TTGCGC). In the case of the <em>T. pantotropha</em> <em>nirS</em> gene
the hexanucleotide is centred at -16.5 relative to the transcription start site. This sequence
lies in a similar position relative to the NNR box in all of the NNR-regulated genes and the
conservation in terms of sequence and position strongly suggests a role for this region of
sequence. Closer examination of the region that includes the TTGCGC hexanucleotide
reveals some similarity to a family of promoters that are dependent on an alternative sigma
factor, designated variously as <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^{54}\)</span>, NtrA or RpoN. RpoN-dependent promoters were first
identified in genes involved in nitrogen fixation <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-beynon_nif_1983" role="doc-biblioref">341</a>]</span> and have since been
identified in several organisms where they regulate a diverse range of functions
<span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-romermann_rpon-like_1989" role="doc-biblioref">342</a>]</span>. RpoN differs from the better-known <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^{70}\)</span>-dependent RNA
polymerase in that it requires an ATP-binding activator protein in order to initiate
transcription from an open promoter-polymerase complex <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-kustu_expression_1989" role="doc-biblioref">343</a>]</span>. Additionally,
the consensus sequence that is recognised by RpoN differs from the -35/-10 <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^{70}\)</span> sequences
found in <em>E. coli</em> (Figure 7.12). The minimum requirement for an RpoN-dependent promoter
is a GC dinucleotide found 11-14 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site (most
often found at the -12 position) and an invariant GG dinucleotide 10 bp further upstream.
most often at the -24 position <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-thony_2412_1989" role="doc-biblioref">344</a>]</span>. In Figure 7.12 it can be
seen that the regions upstream of <em>nirI</em> and <em>nnr</em> contain these dinucleotides with
the correct spacing relative to each other and some additional sequence conservation at other residues.
However, the <em>nirS</em>, <em>nirE</em> and <em>norCB</em> genes lack one of the guanine residues in the invariant
GG dinucleotide. Additionally, the GC dinucleotide begins at the -17 position in the <em>nirS</em>
genes which is rather far from the more normal -12 position.</p>
<p>It therefore seems unlikely that the sigma factor involved in transcription of the
denitrification genes is the RpoN protein. However, it is still plausible that a similar type of
protein might be involved. Putative RpoN binding sites have been identified in the upstream
regions of some genes involved in denitrification, including the <em>Ps. stutzeri</em> Zobell <em>nosZ</em> gene
<span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-cuypers_notitle_1992" role="doc-biblioref">345</a>]</span> and the <em>nnrR</em> gene of <em>R. sphaeroides</em> 2.43 <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-tosques_cloning_1996" role="doc-biblioref">202</a>]</span>.
The effects on denitrification of knocking out the rpon gene in these organisms have yet to
be investigated, although it is known that disruption of the <em>rpoN</em> gene in <em>Ps. aeruginosa</em> has
no effect on denitrification <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-totten_rpon_1990" role="doc-biblioref">346</a>]</span>. In contrast, disruption of the <em>rpoN</em>
(formerly <em>hno</em>) gene in <em>Alcaligenes eutrophus</em> exerts a wide-ranging pleiotropic effect
including the loss of denitrification <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-roemermann_pleotropic_1988" role="doc-biblioref">347</a>]</span>. Although <em>rpoN</em> disruption in
<em>Ps. aeruginosa</em> had no effect on denitrification, it is known that there are promoters in this
organism which resemble RpoN-dependent promoters, in that they possess the GG-N<span class="math inline">\(_{10}\)</span>-GC
motif but the GC dinucleotide is upstream of the normal -12 position and the genes are fully
functional in the absence of RpoN. Intriguingly, one such gene is that which encodes the
FNR homologue ANR in <em>Ps. aeruginosa</em> <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-savioz_pseudomonas_1993" role="doc-biblioref">348</a>]</span> and it has been suggested that
these âRpoN-likeâ promoter regions depend on an alternative sigma factor. In
<em>Bradyrhizobium japonicum</em>, an organism quite closely related to <em>T. pantotropha</em> there are
two <em>rpoN</em> genes encoding the proteins RpoN, and RpoN2, with distinct specificities <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-kullik_bradyrhizobium_1991" role="doc-biblioref">349</a>]</span>.
It is tempting to speculate that this is also the case in <em>T. pantotropha</em> and <em>P. denitrificans</em>
and that one of the RpoN homologues would be involved in denitrification.</p>
<p>Whatever the identity of the sigma factor involved in transcription of denitrifying
genes, a model for its interaction with the promoter and with other regulatory components
would be extremely valuable. At present genes encoding four types of regulatory protein
have been identified in the denitrification gene clusters of the principal denitrifying
organisms. The properties of these proteins are summarised in Table 7.1.</p>

<p>Four of these regulatory proteins (FnrP, NNR, NosR and Nirl) are known to be involved with the
transcription of one or more denitrification genes. NosR mutants in <em>Ps. stutzeri</em> fail to
synthesise nitrous oxide reductase <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-cuypers_nosr_1992" role="doc-biblioref">172</a>]</span>, whilst NNR mutants in <em>P. denitrificans</em> fail
to synthesise the nitrite and nitric oxide reductases <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-van_spanning_nitrite_1995" role="doc-biblioref">195</a>]</span>. FNR and its close homologues
appear to regulate the synthesis of nitrate and nitrous oxide reductases, as well as a number of other genes that are induced under microaerobic
conditions <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-van_spanning_fnrp_1997" role="doc-biblioref">193</a>]</span>. The NirQ protein of <em>Ps. stutzeri</em> seems to be related
to the NtrC family of transcriptional regulators <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-kustu_expression_1989" role="doc-biblioref">343</a>]</span> in that it contains a
nucleotide binding site and a DNA-binding helix-turn-helix motif, but disruption of the <em>nirQ</em>
gene gives rise to a mutant in which nitrite and nitric oxide reductases are present at normal
or slightly elevated levels but are not active <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-jungst_interdependence_1992" role="doc-biblioref">170</a>]</span>. This suggests some
role for NirQ in the modulation of the enzyme activity of these two reductases. The situation
is different again for the NirQ homologue found in <em>P. denitrificans</em>, NorQ; disruption of this
gene substantially reduces the levels of nitrite and nitric oxide reductases <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-de_boer_mutational_1996" role="doc-biblioref">171</a>]</span>.
This may be due to its differing location in the gene cluster; in <em>P. denitrificans</em> <em>norQ</em>
lies amongst the structural genes for nitric oxide reductase <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-de_boer_mutational_1996" role="doc-biblioref">171</a>]</span> whereas in
<em>Ps. stutzeri</em> it is transcribed divergently upstream of the <em>nirS</em> gene <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-jungst_interdependence_1992" role="doc-biblioref">170</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>In <em>P. denitrificans</em> NirI and NNR are the only proteins so far identified as having a
role in transcription of the nirS gene and an understanding of their action is far from
complete. NirI is predicted to be an integral inner membrane protein with seven
transmembrane helices and a putative iron-sulphur cluster <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-de_boer_regulation_1996" role="doc-biblioref">168</a>]</span>. The latter feature
may bind a signal molecule, perhaps as part of a redox-sensing pathway. Although its
homologue NosR in <em>Ps. stutzeri</em> contains a putative DNA-binding helix-turn-helix motif
<span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-cuypers_nosr_1992" role="doc-biblioref">172</a>]</span> it is difficult to conceive of a membrane-bound protein acting directly
as a transcriptional activator, although such a role has also been suggested for the <em>E. coli</em>
FecI protein which is involved in iron dicitrate transport <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-van_hove_novel_1990" role="doc-biblioref">350</a>]</span> and for the
ToxR protein of <em>Vibrio cholerae</em>, which activates the transcription of cholera toxin <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-miller_cholera_1987" role="doc-biblioref">351</a>]</span>.
Therefore, NirI may be a transcriptional activator or it may be linked to a second
as yet unidentified protein which activates transcription from the <em>nirS</em> promoter, in a similar
fashion to the two component regulators such as the NarX-NarL system <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-nohno_narx_1989" role="doc-biblioref">39</a>]</span>.
As the NNR protein probably binds to the <em>nirS</em> NNR-box (although this has not been
demonstrated experimentally) an interaction between NirI and NNR cannot be ruled out.</p>
<p>If NirI is involved in transcriptional activation of the <em>nirS</em> gene the role of the NNR
box upstream of the <em>nirS</em> gene needs to be clarified. The <em>nirI</em> gene itself could be under the
control of NNR as shown in Figure 7.13; due to the palindromic nature of the NNR-binding
site the <em>nirS</em> NNR-box could function on the opposite DNA strand to regulate the expression
of the divergently-transcribed <em>nirI</em> gene.</p>

<p>The alignment in Figure 7.12 shows a number of conserved residues in the upstream regions of the <em>nirI</em> and <em>nirS</em> genes suggesting that this is
probably the case and strengthening the argument for an interaction between NNR and NirI.
Experiments in <em>R. sphaeroides</em> 2.4.3 have shown that the <em>nnrR</em> gene is expressed
constitutively at a low level throughout growth and indicate that the Nnr protein is
activated by an effector, which has been suggested to be nitric oxide. The initial NO signal
would be generated from a low level constitutive activity of the nitrite reductase <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-tosques_cloning_1996" role="doc-biblioref">202</a>]</span>.
In <em>T. pantotropha</em> this is an attractive proposition for two reasons: first, NNR
seems to regulate specifically the nitrite and nitric oxide reductases which are involved with
the production and consumption of nitric oxide and second, these reductases probably only
function at very low oxygen concentrations. As nitric oxide is highly reactive with oxygen,
it would be diverted away from bioenergetically-useful reduction by nitric oxide reductase at
high oxygen tensions <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-tosques_cloning_1996" role="doc-biblioref">202</a>]</span>. NirI and NNR might, therefore, function
together as a sensor of redox state or of nitric oxide concentration at lower oxygen
concentrations than FNR, to co-ordinate the expression of the nitrite and nitric oxide
reductases. Two important experiments would clarify the respective roles of NirI and NNR:
determination of whether NirI is expressed in an <em>nnr</em> mutant strain and conversely, whether
<em>nnr</em> and <em>norCB</em> which are NNR-dependent are expressed in a <em>nirI</em> mutant.</p>
<p>It is clear that much remains to be learned about the mechanisms of regulation during
denitrification in <em>P. denitrificans</em>, <em>T. pantotropha</em> and other micro-organisms. It is very
likely that further components of the regulatory pathway remain to be discovered and the
role of other environmental factors, such as N-oxides remains to be elucidated. For example,
it is known that nitrate and nitrite can influence the expression of denitrification genes, most
probably through a system similar to the NarX-NarL system of <em>E. coli</em>, although these genes
have not yet been discovered in any denitrifying bacterium. In terms of the transcription of
the <em>nirS</em> gene in <em>T. pantotropha</em>, a number of future experiments can be suggested. First, it
needs to be demonstrated that the <em>nirS</em> and <em>nirE</em> genes each have their own promoter as
suggested by the Northern blotting experiments. This should be achieved quite soon using
transcriptional or translational fusions with reporter genes downstream of the putative
promoter regions. The roles of individual residues in the promoter region can then be
investigated further, initially by deletions of whole parts of these regions and ultimately
using site-directed mutagenesis. The nature of the RNA polymerase also needs to be
elucidated; the <em>T. pantotropha</em> genome should be probed for the presence of one or more
copies of an RpoN-like gene and disruption of the gene(s) carried out to determine if this
sigma factor is involved in denitrification. Whatever the sigma factor proves to be, the
ultimate proof of its function will be to show that in conjunction with NNR it drives
transcription <em>in vitro</em> from the <em>nirS</em> promoter. DNA protection studies of the promoter region
using NNR and RNA polymerase will eventually show directly the location of the RNA
polymerase contact sites and may allow the definition of a consensus binding site for the
RNA polymerase.</p>

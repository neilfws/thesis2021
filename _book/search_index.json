Saunders September 1997 Preliminary Content Abstract The nirS gene, which encodes the enzyme cytochrome cd1 nitrite reductase in the denitrifying bacterium Thiosphaera pantotropha, was cloned and sequenced. The sequence of this cytochrome cd1 was found to be very similar to those of the proteins not only from the closely-related organism P. denitrificans but also several other species of bacteria. However, the N-terminal region of these proteins shows less similarity than the overall protein sequence. Furthermore, sequence analysis in combination with spectroscopic and structural data indicates that the ligands to the c- and d1-haem groups are not identical in cytochromes cd1 from different sources. Implications for the mechanism of the enzyme are discussed. Three different approaches were taken to the problem of expressing recombinant cytochrome cd1 from the cloned nirS gene. First, the gene was expressed in Escherichia coli, yielding a semi-apo enzyme that contained only the c-type haem. The protein could be reconstituted to some degree using purified haem d1, producing an enzyme with some of the spectroscopic features of the native holoenzyme and around 50% of the native nitrite reductase activity. This approach should be of use in the future expression of site-directed mutants of cytochrome cd1, which would be structurally unstable or enzymically inactive if expressed as the holoenzyme in a heterologous denitrifying host. Second, the T. pantotropha nirS gene was expressed in the denitrifying bacterium Ps. aeruginosa which synthesises an endogenous cytochrome cd1. Under the growth conditions employed, a mixture of holo- and semi-apo recombinant cytochrome cd1 was produced. Differences in the visible spectrum of the holoenzyme and attenuated nitrite reductase and cytochrome c oxidase activities suggested that it was not fully assembled in this system. However, the system may be of use in distinguishing site-directed mutants of the enzyme that are enzymically inactive from those that retain some activity. Third, an unmarked deletion was constructed in the genomic copy of the T. pantotropha nirS gene which abolished the synthesis of cytochrome cd1. It then proved possible to restore denitrifying growth to the mutant by complementation with the cloned wild-type nirS gene. However, complementation using a site-directed mutant of cytochrome cd1, in which the d1 haem ligand Tyr-25 was replaced with phenylalanine failed to restore growth and the cells contained greatly attenuated levels of the mutant cytochrome cd1. Possible reasons for this result are discussed. These data illustrate the problem of finding an expression system that can synthesise the holoenzyme but does not rely upon its activity to maintain the growth of the host organism. The transcription start site of the nirS gene was determined using 5’-RACE and primer extension. The nirS gene was found to be transcribed as a monocistronic mRNA. Comparison of the upstream region of the nirS gene with other denitrification genes indicates a common mechanism of transcriptional regulation and suggests that such genes may be transcribed using a specific sigma factor.

One of these cycles is the nitrogen cycle shown schematically in Figure 1.1. Figure 1.1: The nitrogen cycle. The oxidation state of nitrogen in each intermediate is given in brackets. Denitrification is shown by black arrows, nitrogen fixation by a dark grey arrow and all other reactions by light grey arrows. Note that nitrification involves two reactions, oxidation of ammonia to nitrite and of nitrite to nitrate, but these have never been found together in the same organism. ANAMOX (anaerobic ammonia oxidation) is a poorly-characterised process in which nitrite and ammonia combine to give water and dinitrogen.1 The cycle involves the interconversion between various oxidation states of nitrogen and is predominantly carried out by micro-organisms. A simplified view of the nitrogen cycle is one of a balance between two opposing processes. In nitrogen fixation atmospheric dinitrogen gas is reduced to ammonia, allowing the assimilation of nitrogen into biological molecules. Nitrogen is released back into the environment as ammonium during decay, oxidised to nitrate and converted to dinitrogen gas by the process of denitrification, the left hand branch of Figure 1.1. This involves the sequential reduction of nitrate to nitrite, nitric oxide, nitrous oxide and finally nitrogen, in a series of enzyme-catalysed reactions. The individual reactions of denitrification can be referred to as respiratory N-oxide reduction, because the process is used to generate ATP via a proton electrochemical gradient across the cytoplasmic membrane. The term dissimilatory N-oxide reduction is also used to indicate that the products are lost to the environment; this distinguishes the reactions from the assimilatory reductions used by plants and bacteria to incorporate nitrogen into biomass. 1.1.1 The importance of denitrification Denitrification was first reported last century2 and it has since been the focus of much research, spanning a variety of disciplines. Factors that affect the levels of N-oxides in the environment are of great ecological interest. For example, nitrous oxide, the penultimate compound in the pathway, has been implicated as a contributor to global warming and as an agent capable of destroying stratospheric ozone.3 Denitrification is a route by which soil nitrogen may be lost, with implications for agricultural productivity.4 The removal of nitrogenous compounds in waste water treatment by bioremediation is an important field, particularly in small countries such as the Netherlands,5 and the contribution of polluting nitrates in groundwater to eutrophication is another concern.6 Nitrate and nitrite levels in the environment may also have health consequences, through conditions such as methaemoglobinaemia7 and certain stomach cancers (caused by conversion of nitrites to N-nitroso compounds in the stomach).8 Information about microbial N-oxide metabolism may therefore be relevant to many researchers. In recent years denitrifying bacteria have proven to be extremely interesting systems for the study of fundamental prokaryotic biochemistry, physiology and molecular genetics, and this aspect of denitrification is the main concern of this thesis. As a bioenergetic process, the enzymes involved may be used to investigate electron transfer and proton translocation, both of which are poorly understood at present. Biogenesis of the enzymes, in terms of targeting and compartmentalisation, folding and assembly of their various metal centres is another fundamental process. The catalytic mechanisms of each enzyme also attract research, particularly as several of the proteins involved are soluble, easy to purify in large amounts and, in some cases, have had their crystal structures determined. Finally there is always the possibility that study of prokaryotic systems may provide structural models for analogous eukaryotic processes. As an example, the bacterial cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) nitrite reductase (Section 1.5) generates bound nitric oxide which must be released from a haem group. In eukaryotes, nitric oxide participates in signal transduction by binding to a haem group on the enzyme guanyl cyclase, from which it must also be released.9 1.2 The denitrifying micro-organisms Denitrification research has traditionally focused on the Gram-negative bacteria (those containing a compartment between the cytoplasmic and outer membranes termed the periplasm) and until quite recently, respiratory N-oxide reduction was considered to be an exclusively prokaryotic attribute. This situation has altered somewhat with the discovery that at least two species of fungus, Fusarium oxysporum and Cylindrocarpon tonkinense can reduce nitrite to nitrous oxide.10,11 In F. oxysporum, N-oxide reduction is localised to the mitochondrion12 and is comprised of distinct enzymes for the dissimilatory reduction of nitrate,11 nitrite13 and nitric oxide.14 The system is significantly different to that found in bacteria, particularly the nitric oxide reductase which is a unique cytochrome P450-type enzyme. The bacteria studied to date tend to fall into two groups; those in which at least one enzyme of the denitrification pathway has attracted interest, although the complete pathway has not been investigated (or may not be present), and those in which the complete denitrification pathway from nitrate through to dinitrogen has been characterised. Escherichia coli falls into the former category; although not a denitrifier, it possesses a membrane-bound nitrate reductase15 and a putative periplasmic nitrate reductase,16 encoded by the nar and nap gene clusters, respectively, which are essentially identical to those found in the denitrifying bacteria. The genetic amenability of this organism and its wider importance in biochemical and genetic research has encouraged investigation of these enzymes; for example extensive sequencing of the E. coli genome allowed the identification of the E. coli nap gene cluster during a DNA database search using the Thiosphaera pantotropha nap genes.17 Also in the first category are denitrifiers where one enzyme in the pathway has been singled out as being of specific interest. Examples include Achromobacter cycloclastes and Alcaligenes faecalis S-6; these organisms contain a copper nitrite reductase (Section 1.4.3), the X-ray crystal structures of which have been determined to high resolution.18,19 This work has provided a great deal of information on copper centres and possible mechanisms of nitrite reduction. However, the core of denitrification research concerns bacteria from the latter category; those in which the four enzymes required for complete denitrification have been identified and at least partially characterised. Many such species have been described20 but the best studied are Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas stutzeri and Paracoccus denitrificans (and its close relatives, particularly T. pantotropha). P. denitrificans has long been of interest in the field of bioenergetics, due to the close similarity between its aerobic respiratory chain and that of the eukaryotic mitochondrion.21 P. denitrificans has also been the subject of a great deal of metabolic research, due to its nutritional versatility. As well as growing anaerobically with nitrate as terminal electron acceptor, P. denitrificans can grow chemoautotrophically on inorganic substrates such as hydrogen or thiosulphate, chemoheterotrophically on organic acids such as acetate or succinate and methylotrophically, on methanol or methylamine. As with other bacteria denitrifying growth in P. denitrificans is an anaerobic process used as an alternative to aerobic respiration when oxygen, the preferred terminal electron acceptor, is in short supply. 1.3 Organisation of the denitrifying electron transport chain Although denitrification is relatively widespread amongst the prokaryotes, detailed biochemical information is available for only a small number of organisms. However, the current model of the organisation of the denitrifying respiratory chain is shown in Figure 1.2. Figure 1.2: The denitrifying electron transport chain of Paracoccus denitrificans. The enzymes shown are: NarGHI, nitrate reductase, FbcFBC, cytochrome bc\\(_1\\) complex, NorBC, nitric oxide reductase, NirS, cyochrome cd\\(_1\\) nitrite reductase, NosZ, nitrous oxide reductase. ‘Q’ represents the ubiquinol/ubiquinone pool. Chemical reactions are indicated by solid arrows, proton translocation by dashed arrows and electron transfer by dotted arrows, with the stoichiometry shown in each case. Proton translocation at the cytochrome bc\\(_1\\) complex is described by the proton-motive Q-cycle (see text for details). Not shown is the periplasmic nitrate reductase, which is not present during anaerobic denitrifying growth conditions. This diagram is based on the organism Paracoccus denitrificans, but is probably similar in other bacteria, particularly Ps. aeruginosa and Ps. stutzeri. During anaerobic denitrifying growth, a standard tricarboxylic acid cycle is employed, generating the reductants NADH and succinate. The cytoplasmic membrane thus contains prokaryotic homologues of the classical respiratory complexes: complex I (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase), complex II (succinate-ubiquinone oxidoreductase) and complex III (ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase), in addition to the integral membrane proteins nitrate and nitric oxide reductase. Nitrate reductase is believed to accept electrons from the ubiquinol pool. In contrast, the other three N-oxide reductases are believed to receive electrons from the cytochrome bc\\(_1\\) complex via small periplasmic electron transport proteins. Net proton translocation is achieved by the operation of the proton motive Q-cycle in the cytochrome bc\\(_1\\) complex22 and the activity of Complex I. The reactions of N-oxide reduction are therefore periplasmic, with the exception of nitrate reduction which occurs in the cytoplasm;23 this implies a transporter for entry of nitrate and export of nitrite to the periplasm (Section 1.4.1). Denitrification is an energy conserving process. Consideration of the reduction potentials associated with each step (Table 1.1) suggests that each reaction is relatively exergonic, yielding sufficient free energy to drive the synthesis of ATP. Table 1.1: Reduction potentials and thermodynamics of the reactions of denitrification compared with those of the oxygen/water couple, assuming NADH as the reductant. The four reactions of denitrification are shown for the reduction of two molecules of nitrate; this is to balance the overall equation as two nitric oxide molecules are required to dimerise, forming one molecule of nitrous oxide. The reduction potentials of each couple under biological standard state conditions (1 atm pressure for gases, solutions at 1 M, pH 7.0, at 298 K) are shown. Assuming NADH to be the reductant for each reaction allows the free energy change to be calculated as shown in column four, using the equation \\(\\Delta\\)G°’ = -nF\\(\\Delta\\)E°‘, where \\(\\Delta\\)G°’ = Gibbs free energy change, n = number of electrons transferred, F = 96 500 C mol\\(^-1\\) and \\(\\Delta\\)E°’ = redox span between reductant and oxidant. This shows that the reduction of nitric and nitrous oxides is associated with a greater free energy change per reducing equivalent (two electrons) than that of oxygen to water. The overall denitrification reaction also has a comparable free energy change to that of oxygen reduction. However, as explained in the main text, standard state conditions are unlikely to occur in the cell and, additionally, the topology of the denitrifying electron transport chain results in a lower ATP:2e\\(^-\\) stoichiometry than that of the aerobic respiratory chain.

However, it must be born in mind that these values refer to standard state conditions and will be different in the cell; for instance the actual concentration of N\\(_2\\)O will be rather lower than one atmosphere. Furthermore, the spatial arrangement of the components involved in the electron transport sequence influences the stoichiometry of net proton translocation per pair of electrons passing through the electron transport chain. Termination of the denitrifying electron transport chain with nitrous oxide reductase results in no net proton translocation across the redox span from cytochrome c to nitrous oxide, whereas oxygen reduction by the cytochrome aa\\(_3\\) oxidase results in the equivalent of four protons translocated per pair of electrons. Thus, assuming a constant H\\(^+\\):ATP ratio for the ATP synthase, nitrous oxide respiration gives a lower ATP:2e\\(^-\\) ratio than does oxygen respiration. Nevertheless, denitrification represents an important alternative mode of respiration for those bacteria which have evolved the necessary enzymatic machinery, allowing them to exploit a wider range of environmental niches than obligate aerobes. In the following sections, the enzymes of denitrification are discussed in more detail. The order of discussion is the same as that of each reaction in the pathway, with the exception of the cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) nitrite reductase; as this enzyme is the main focus of the project it is treated in greater detail after the others. 1.4 Enzymes of the denitrifying electron transport chain 1.4.1 The membrane-bound nitrate reductase Membrane-bound nitrate reductase (Nar) is widely distributed, being found in many enteric bacteria as well as the denitrifying species. The most extensively characterised examples are from E. coli24 and P. denitrificans.25 Nitrate reductase from these sources is composed of three subunits with molecular masses of around 140 kDa (\\(\\alpha\\)), 60 kDa (\\(\\beta\\)) and 25 kDa (\\(\\gamma\\)), as judged by SDS-PAGE. The \\(\\gamma\\) subunit anchors the other two subunits to the cytoplasmic side of the cytoplasmic membrane and an \\(\\alpha\\beta\\) complex can be released from inside-out membrane vesicles by washing with EDTA or magnesium-free buffer.23 Loss of the \\(\\gamma\\) subunit during purification is accompanied by an apparent proteolytic cleavage at the C-terminus of the \\(\\beta\\) subunit.26 The inference from these studies is that the a\\(\\beta\\) complex contacts the \\(\\gamma\\) subunit through a region near the carboxy end of the \\(\\beta\\) subunit polypeptide chain. Stoichiometry of the subunits is uncertain, but is thought most likely to be \\(\\alpha1\\beta1\\gamma1\\); in E. coli the genes appear to have overlapping start and stop codons, which would result in translational coupling27 and a stoichiometric synthesis of the subunits. Membrane-bound nitrate reductase is a quinol oxidase, receiving from the quinol pool the two electrons required to reduce a molecule of nitrate. The electrons are transported through the complex by a variety of cofactors. The \\(\\gamma\\) subunit contains two b-type haems;23 modelling studies suggest that these conduct electrons from ubiquinol across the cytoplasmic membrane, leaving two protons in the periplasm in a classical “redox loop” mechanism.28 The \\(\\alpha\\beta\\) complex contains several iron-sulphur clusters29 and the \\(\\alpha\\) subunit contains in addition a complex cofactor termed molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide (MGD).30 All bacterial nitrate reductases contain this cofactor, a variant of molybdopterin which in this case is conjugated to guanosine monophosphate. MGD-dependent enzymes form a large family, whose members include soluble and membrane-bound nitrate reductases, formate dehydrogenases and S-oxide reductases. Amino acid similarities between these sequences have been used to establish a number of sub-families and to identify conserved regions involved in the binding of metal cofactors.31 A great deal of spectroscopic data has been amassed for the MGD cofactor, which receives electrons from the neighbouring \\(\\beta\\) subunit, binds nitrate and catalyses an oxo-transfer reaction between nitrate and water.32 EPR spectroscopy and mechanistic studies indicate that the molybdenum atom cycles between Mo(IV) and Mo(VI) states and is the site of the oxo-transfer reaction.33 The complexity of the cofactor, in terms of the organic dithiolene moiety, is argued to provide a specific binding site for the Mo atom.34 This has been confirmed by two recent crystal structures of the enzymes dimethyl sulphoxide reductase35 and formate dehydrogenase H.36 Both of these structures show that the molybdenum ion is co-ordinated by two MGD molecules through the dithiolene groups. The structural genes for the three subunits of the complex, narGHI, have been cloned and sequenced from E. coli. A fourth gene, narJ, is found in this operon which encodes a cytoplasmic protein thought to be involved in biosynthesis of the complex.37 This has been referred to as the \\(\\delta\\) subunit but does not copurify with the enzyme. The T. pantotropha narJ and narHI genes have also been sequenced.28 In E. coli, a second nitrate reductase operon, narZYWV, arising from gene duplication, is also found.38 The E. coli narGHIJ operon is also linked to three other genes nar genes, narXL, a two-component nitrate/nitrite sensing regulator,39 Section 1.7.3 and narK, a putative nitrite exporter,40 or nitrate/nitrite antiporter.41 Nitrate reduction is cytoplasmic; in E. coli the product nitrite may be reduced to ammonia by a cytoplasmic sirohaem-containing enzyme42 or under some circumstances, exported to the periplasm by narK and reduced there by a c haem-containing nitrite reductase.43 A similar system for nitrite export must operate in the denitrifying bacteria and has often assumed to be a nitrate/nitrite antiporter. No such protein has yet been identified in denitrifying bacteria, though other transport systems have been identified in prokaryotes In the cyanobacteria these include an active transporter of the ABC type44 and a sodium-linked symporter,45 both of which may transport nitrate and nitrite, although nitrate reduction in these organisms is assimilatory rather than respiratory. 1.4.2 The periplasmic nitrate reductase Periplasmic nitrate reductases have been purified from several bacteria, including R. capsulatus,46 T. pantotropha47 and A. eutrophus.48 In addition, the complete gene locus nap has been mapped and sequenced from T. pantotropha,16 R. sphaeroides49 and E. coli.17 Although purified from a relatively small number of species the enzyme is probably widespread amongst the Proteobacteria; probes for the gene have been used to isolate up to forty species of bacteria from soil and water environments in one locale.50 The enzyme is a heterodimer of two subunits, NapA (90 kDa) and NapB (16 kDa).47 NapB is a dihaem cytochrome c\\(_{552}\\), which is believed to accept electrons from ubiquinol, via a quinol oxidase complex (possibly the napE gene product) and a tetrahaem cytochrome c (encoded by napC,).16 NapA is the catalytic site, containing the MGD cofactor and, at least in T. pantotropha, an iron-sulphur cluster.51 The enzyme is catalytically distinct from the membrane-bound nitrate reductase, in that it is not competitively inhibited by azide, nor can it reduce chlorate or bromate.47 Extensive sequencing of the nap loci in T. pantotropha, R. sphaeroides and E. coli (the aeg-46.5 locus) has revealed a number of open reading frames besides those of the structural genes. T. pantotropha contains the aforementioned napE and napC, as well as napD, coding for a cytoplasmic protein of unknown function. E. coli contains napF, napG and napH; these proteins have been suggested to bind iron-sulphur clusters and to be involved in electron transport to NapAB.31 In addition, there are a number of genes downstream of the nap cluster involved in c-type cytochrome biogenesis52 and narP, a nitrate/nitrite response regulator (Section 1.7.3). The physiological role of the periplasmic nitrate reductase is not especially clear and may even vary in different organisms. In T. pantotropha, the enzyme was initially assigned a role in aerobic denitrification, a feature that originally distinguished this organism from the very closely related P. denitrificans.53 One rationale for this is that oxygen is known to inhibit nitrate transport to the cytoplasm,54 the site of reduction by the membrane-bound reductase, whereas a periplasmic location would effectively bypass this route of inhibition. However, more recent research seems to suggest that T. pantotropha does not denitrify aerobically to the extent previously reported,55 perhaps as a result of repeated sub-culturing in the laboratory. Furthermore, P. denitrificans also possesses a periplasmic nitrate reductase and synthesis of the other enzymes of denitrification appears to be quite strictly controlled by anaerobiosis. However, the periplasmic nitrate reductase may be expressed under conditions of stress (such as entering stationary phase,)48 and as at least pre-synthesised cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) nitrite reductase appears to persist on switching from anaerobic to aerobic growth,56 the enzyme may play a role in aerobic denitrification as an adaptation to cope with rapidly changing levels of aeration in the environment. Other roles have been suggested for the enzyme, involving the concepts of redox balance and redox poise. In photoheterotrophs and chemoheterotrophs, an optimum ratio of ubiquinol:ubiquinone is required to maintain turnover of enzyme complexes such as NADH dehydrogenase, the cytochrome bc\\(_1\\) complex and the photosynthetic reaction centre.31 Certain growth conditions such as low light intensity or the provision of highly reduced carbon substrate can lead to an increase in the UQH\\(_2\\):UQ ratio and a fall in growth rate. The quinol oxidase activity of periplasmic nitrate reductase would alleviate this by consuming ubiquinol. There is good evidence for this model; in T. pantotropha, aerobic growth on the highly-reduced substrate butyrate results in a ten-fold increase in Nap expression compared to succinate,57 whilst nitrate reduction in photosynthetic R. capsulatus is markedly increased under low light intensity.58 1.4.3 The copper nitrite reductase Copper nitrite reductase is one of two types of eubacterial dissimilatory nitrite reductase, the other being the cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) enzyme discussed in Section 1.5. The two enzymes are distributed fairly evenly amongst bacteria with a slight preponderance of the cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) enzyme.59 There is no correlation between genus (or even species) and the type of nitrite reductase present; for example Alcaligenes eutrophus H16 contains the cd\\(_1\\) type60 as does A. faecalis strain IAM 1015,61 whereas A. faecalis S-6 contains the copper enzyme.62 The two enzymes are never found in the same organism but are functionally equivalent; expression of the copper nitrite reductase gene nirK in a Ps. stutzeri mutant lacking cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) restores nitrite reductase activity.63 Copper nitrite reductases have been purified from several Gram-negative bacteria, including Achromobacter cycloclastes,64 Alcaligenes faecalis S-662 and Pseudomonas aureofaciens65 and one Gram-positive bacterium, Bacillus halodenitrificans.66 It now seems clear that all the enzymes are homotrimeric, with each 37 kDa subunit containing a variant of a type I centre and one type II copper centre. Type I centres are mononuclear, cysteine-ligated, have high redox potentials and are an intense blue colour (but see below). They are always involved in electron transfer, rather than catalysis. Type II copper centres contain a single copper atom, with spectroscopic properties similar to those of inorganic copper complexes. They are ligated predominantly by histidine residues and are involved with catalysis at the active site, where substrate or exogenous ligands can displace a water-derived ligand. The type I centre in the copper nitrite reductase from A. cycloclastes is unusual in that it produces an intense green absorption at 458 nm; this is thought to be due to a short Cu-S-Met distance and substantial charge transfer through this bond.67 Copper nitrite reductases are relatively well understood due to the elucidation of two X-ray crystal structures from the organisms A. cycloclastes18 and A. faecalis S-6.19 These have revealed that each monomer forms two \\(\\beta\\) barrel domains stabilised by a helical region. The histidine, cysteine and methionine ligands to the copper centres have also been identified; the type II copper centres are positioned at the subunit interfaces and share ligands from adjacent subunits. These centres can be removed and reconstituted, showing them to be the site of nitrite reduction. Some site directed mutagenesis of copper nitrite reductase has been carried out, which has identified the important role of the copper ligands,19 and the negatively-charged surface residues thought to interact with the electron donor pseudoazurin (Section 1.4.6).68 A mechanism of nitrite reduction has been proposed which is quite similar to the cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) enzyme (Section 1.5), involving protonation of the N-bound nitrite molecule by a neighbouring histidine residue, followed by dehydration to give a cuprous-NO+ species and followed by release of nitric oxide. The active site of copper nitrite reductase is comparable to that of carbonic anhydrase in that a number of similarly placed histidine residues act as proton donors.69 However, there may be some mechanistic differences between the copper nitrite reductase and cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) -type nitrite reductase. No evidence for a Cu(I)-NO+ species has been obtained by H\\({_2}^{18}\\)O exchange experiments using the copper nitrite reductase,70 and the enzyme also seems to produce significant amounts of N\\(_2\\)O as judged by isotope exchange experiments.71 This occurs when nitric oxide levels are quite high, implying reaction between a labile Cu-NO species and NO or NO\\(_2^-\\). However, as with cytochrome cd\\(_1\\), this may not occur physiologically, as NO is normally rapidly removed in the cell by the activity of nitric oxide reductase (see below). 1.4.4 The nitric oxide reductase For many years, it was unclear whether the product of nitrite reduction was nitric oxide or nitrous oxide and, if the former, whether nitric oxide was a free intermediate in denitrification. This situation has now been resolved by a number of methods: (1) trapping experiments using haemoglobin have shown nitric oxide to be freely diffusible,72 (2) membranes of mutants lacking nitrite reductase still possess a nitric oxide reductase activity73 and most conclusively, (3) a distinct nitric oxide reductase enzyme has been identified, purified and shown to be essential for denitrification by gene disruption. Nitric oxide reductase has now been purified from several sources, including P. denitrificans,74 A. cycloclastes75 and Ps. stutzeri.76 On SDS-PAGE gels two subunits are seen; a cytochrome c of 17 kDa containing a single haem and a larger subunit (of apparent molecular mass 37 kDa, though actually 53 kDa from the gene sequence), binding a b-type haem. The enzyme also contains non-haem iron.76 Biochemical studies of the protein solubilised in detergent vesicles have been carried out; cytochrome c\\(_{550}\\) can donate electrons to the enzyme and the K\\(_m\\) for nitric oxide under these conditions is sub-micromolar.74 This measurement seems reasonable as NO concentrations in whole cells are generally 10\\(^{-7}\\) M or less.77 Redox titrations have revealed only two redox components in the enzyme; the c haem component (+225 mV in P. denitrificans, +280 mV in Ps. stutzeri) and the b haem component (+305 mV or +322 mV in the same organisms respectively, Chan and Ferguson, unpublished work,).78 Early studies reported a stoichiometry of two haems per NorBC complex,76 but more recent work indicates that there are two b-type haems (one high-spin that can bind carbon monoxide, the other low-spin), one c haem and one non-haem iron per enzyme complex (79,80). The membrane-bound nature of the enzyme makes purification quite difficult and it now seems that the earlier estimates of haem stoichiometry were erroneous. The problems outlined above have made elucidation of a reaction mechanism for nitric oxide reductase quite problematic; in particular it was difficult to envisage how dimerisation of two NO molecules could be achieved at a single haem binding site. However, the cloning and sequencing of the norBC genes has led to several suggestions for a catalytic mechanism. The NorB subunit has structural similarity to subunit I of cytochrome c oxidase,81 in that both are predicted to have 12 transmembrane helices, with 6 conserved histidines that act as ligands (in the oxidase, to haems a and a\\(_3\\) and to the Cu\\(_{A3}\\) site,.82 Furthermore, like nitric oxide reductase the more primitive cytochrome oxidase, cytochrome cbb\\(_3\\), has a subunit II (FixN) possessing a cytochrome c, rather than a binuclear Cu\\(_A\\) centre.83 These analogies have strengthened the case for two b-type haems and the conserved histidine residues strongly suggest liganding to the non-haem iron identified in later preparations of nitric oxide reductase. This raises the intriguing possibility of NO reduction at a binuclear haem-non-haem iron centre. Modelling of this enzyme family has also been used to suggest an evolutionary progression from nitric oxide reductase, through cytochrome cbb\\(_3\\) to the cytochrome c oxidases, and to imply that the cytochromes cbb\\(_3\\) may have a different mechanism of proton pumping to the haem-copper enzymes, whilst nitric oxide reductase is probably not a proton pump.81 It is notable that cytochrome c oxidase is capable of nitric oxide reduction84 and a recent paper describing nitric oxide reductase from T. pantotropha indicates that it has a cytochrome oxidase activity.79 1.4.5 The nitrous oxide reductase Nitrous oxide reductase, the final enzyme of the denitrification pathway is one of the most comprehensively studied of the denitrifying enzymes. It has been purified from numerous sources, including Ps. stutzeri,85 P. denitrificans,86 Ps. aeruginosa87 and A. faecalis.88 The enzyme appears essentially identical from all sources, being a homodimer of subunits each with a molecular mass of around 70 kDa. Nitrous oxide reductase is a soluble, periplasmic enzyme and contains four copper atoms per polypeptide.85 Spectroscopic models indicate that two types of site are present; a Cu\\(_A\\) site (sometimes termed the “purple copper centre” due to its distinctive colour), related to that found in cytochrome c oxidase and which functions in electron transfer, and a catalytic site, variously termed Cu\\(_B\\), Cu\\(_C\\) or Cu\\(_Z\\), the latter term being preferred. Of these the Cu\\(_A\\) site is the better understood and has been extensively modelled on the basis of EPR and MCD data. It is similar to the site found in cytochrome c oxidase;89 sequence similarity between the C-terminal of nitrous oxide reductase and cytochrome c oxidase subunit II (which binds Cu\\(_A\\)) has been used to predict the ligands to the nitrous oxide reductase copper centre.90 In general, these predictions are supported by spectroscopic studies. The EPR spectrum of this centre is quite unusual and suggests that one electron is delocalised over both copper atoms, making the centre a one-electron acceptor.91 The catalytic Cu\\(_Z\\) site is rather less well understood, largely because it has fewer distinct spectroscopic properties. It has also been modelled by91 and it is also thought to be dinuclear, containing 2 Cu(II) atoms. Reduction using dithionite is thought to reduce only one of these atoms to Cu(I), giving a dead-end product which is enzymically inactive. Ligands to the Cu\\(_Z\\) site have been suggested by examining conserved residues known not to be involved with the Cu\\(_A\\) site; 8 histidines and a single cysteine are possible candidates. The enzymology of nitrous oxide reductase is rather complex. Two forms of the protein can be purified; the purple form (isolated anaerobically) and the pink form (isolated aerobically), with distinct spectroscopic features,92 the anaerobic form having a higher specific activity. Reduction of the enzyme with dithionite followed by oxidation by molecular oxygen converts the purple form to the pink form. Dithionite reduction alone produces a third form of the enzyme, the “blue” form which still contains oxidised copper; this is associated with the Cu\\(_Z\\) centre. The enzyme is inhibited by acetylene, azide, carbon monoxide and cyanide,93 which presumably can act as copper ligands at one or both of the copper centres. The purified enzyme shows the highest activities when assayed with reduced viologens as electron donors, activities using the presumed physiological donors are lower. However, turnover-dependent inactivation has been noted for some of these donors e.g..94 The activity of the enzyme from some species has been increased by incubation with reduced viologens86 and also by exposure to high pH buffer;85 the latter induces a permanent chemical change and it has been suggested that this reaction converts inactive forms of the Cu\\(_Z\\) site to active species, perhaps by regenerating a thiolate ion.31 The complexity of the copper sites in nitrous oxide reductase has slowed progress in the understanding of its mechanism. However, the dinuclear nature of the Cu\\(_Z\\) site suggests that nitrous oxide is bound as a bridging ligand between the two copper atoms; following electron transfer from the Cu\\(_A\\) site, the N-O bond could be activated for cleavage, releasing dinitrogen. The intermolecular electron transfer is another intriguing aspect of this enzyme, in particular why the unusual purple copper centre is used in preference to the more normal type I blue copper centre. The electron pathway through the enzyme (whether through hydrogen bonds/through space or through covalent bonds) is another problem that remains to be elucidated. The structural gene for nitrous oxide reductase, nosZ, has been cloned and sequenced from a number of sources, allowing the sequence analyses described previously. In Ps. stutzeri,95 it is part of a large denitrification cluster containing a number of genes believed to be involved in biosynthesis of the enzyme. Similar clusters are thought to exist in Ps. aeruginosa90 and P. denitrificans,96 though there is no evidence of the accessory genes in A. eutrophus.90 The nos gene cluster is discussed more fully in Section 1.6, in relation to the other genes of denitrification. An interesting feature of the nosZ genes is that the encoded NosZ protein appears to have an unusually long periplasmic targeting sequence (58-60 amino acids), compared to the more usual 26 or less.97 Another unusual feature is that the N-termini of the targeting sequences contain a quite highly conserved motif; these features have been suggested to point to a common export pathway for periplasmic proteins with complex metal cofactors.98 1.4.6 Small electron transfer proteins The periplasms of Gram-negative bacteria contain a variety of small, soluble redox proteins. These are assumed to mediate electron transfer between membrane-bound redox complexes, such as the cytochrome bc\\(_1\\) complex and the periplasmic enzymes, including those of denitrification, although in few cases has an in vivo reaction been directly demonstrated. The small electron transfer proteins group into two types: the small cytochromes c and the cupredoxins. The cytochromes c are a large family of proteins, that have been grouped into various families by consideration of size, sequence similarity and physicochemical properties.99 They have been popular subjects for the study of protein structure and function for many years and a vast literature exists on the subject, which can only be briefly summarised here. The periplasmic cytochromes c involved in electron transfer include cytochrome c\\(_{550}\\) from P. denitrificans, cytochrome c\\(_{551}\\) from Ps. aeruginosa and cytochrome c\\(_2\\) from Rhodobacter capsulatus. These proteins are characterised as Class I cytochromes c: they are generally small (80-120 amino acids), and contain one covalently bound c haem. The haem group is low-spin, co-ordinated by histidine and methionine and found near the N terminus of the protein. Many crystal structures have been determined, revealing a mostly a helical structure, a crevice in which the haem group is buried and a positively-charged face around the haem edge, through which redox partners may interact by electrostatic interactions.100 The cupredoxins are a family of small (around 13 kDa) copper-containing proteins containing what are known as type I or “blue copper” centres. They contain a single copper atom which is involved in electron transfer with donor and acceptor proteins. Cupredoxins absorb intensely near 600 nm giving them an intense blue colour. The copper atom is liganded by two histidine residues, a cysteine and a weak methionine ligand; subtle variations in the ligand geometry give rise to four spectroscopic sub-classes of cupredoxin: (i) azurins, (ii) pseudoazurins, (iii) plastocyanin/amicyanin, (iv) stellacyanin and associated proteins. Examples of cupredoxins include pseudoazurin from T. pantotropha,101 azurin from Ps. aeruginosa102 and amicyanin from P. denitrificans.103 A number of X-ray crystal structures are known which show a high degree of similarity; cupredoxins contain a Greek key \\(\\beta\\)-barrel fold, consisting of 8 \\(\\beta\\) sheets. As with the cytochromes c, surface regions that govern the interactions between the cupredoxins and their redox partners have been defined; in azurin, His-117 is thought to transfer electrons to partners bound by a patch of hydrophobic residues around this residue.104 However, recent analysis of several redox partners has introduced the concept of pseudospecific interactions, in which both hydrophobic patches and oppositely charged surface regions act to bring proteins together and promote electron transfer.105 Proteins are generally assumed to be physiological redox partners on the basis of their reactivity in in vitro assays, as it is difficult to prove an in vivo relationship. Where this has been attempted, mutant strains lacking the small redox protein under study have been used. A mutant of P. denitrificans lacking cytochrome c\\(_{550}\\) has been shown to denitrify at a similar rate to the wild-type organism but anaerobic growth becomes sensitive to diethyldithiocarbamate (a copper chelator), suggesting a role for a copper protein (probably pseudoazurin) in electron transport.106 It is often the case that other redox proteins can substitute for an absent protein in redox carrier mutants; for example a mutant of R. capsulatus lacking cytochrome c\\(_2\\) can still grow photosynthetically, because a membrane-bound cytochrome c takes over its role.107 Redox partners may also be inferred from co-expression. In P. denitrificans grown methylotrophically, two additional cytochromes (c\\(_{551i}\\) and c\\(_{553i}\\),)108 and the copper protein amicyanin103 appear, suggesting that they are involved in electron transfer to or from the methanol dehydrogenase. 1.5 The cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) nitrite reductase Cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) nitrite reductase is the alternative dissimilatory nitrite reductase to the copper enzyme (Section 1.4.3). Cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) was first isolated from Ps. aeruginosa.109 It reduces oxygen and has been referred to as soluble cytochrome oxidase, but it was later shown that the physiological role of the enzyme is nitrite reduction. This was based on the findings that the K\\(_m\\) for nitrite is much lower than that for oxygen and that the enzyme is induced during anaerobic growth on nitrate.110 However oxygen reduction still attracts interest; it is known to be a four-electron reduction to water111 and may still prove relevant in the study of membrane bound cytochrome oxidases. Cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) has since been identified, isolated and studied in detail from many sources; some of these include P. denitrificans,112 T. pantotropha,101 Ps. stutzeri,73 A. faecalis,61 A. eutrophus,60 Thiobacillus denitrificans,113 Magnetospirillum magnetotacticum114 and Roseobacter denitrificans (formerly Erythrobacter sp. Och114).115 Their gross properties are all similar, though as will be discussed later, there are important differences between them. The enzyme from Ps. aeruginosa is the most intensively studied of the family in terms of biochemical mechanistic data and most of the discussion below pertains to data from this enzyme. 1.5.1 Subunit structure Cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) from all sources is a dimer of two identical subunits of molecular masses around 55-65 kDa, as judged by SDS-PAGE, size exclusion chromatography and sedimentation analysis.116 Each subunit contains two haem groups; a covalently-bound c haem identical to that found in mitochondrial cytochrome c and a non-covalently bound d\\(_1\\) haem, which is unique to this enzyme (Figure 1.3). Figure 1.3: (a) Structure of d\\(_1\\) haem and (b) of protoporphyrin IX. The d\\(_1\\) haem is unique to cytochrome cd\\(_1\\). Protoporphyrin IX can occur as a non-covalently bound prosthetic group, where it is referred to as b-haem. In c-type cytochromes, protoporphyrin IX binds covalently via the vinyl side chains to two cysteine residues in the polypeptide at the consensus site CXXCH (X = any amino acid). The latter haem is distinguished by the presence of oxo and carboxylate moieties and partial saturation on two adjacent pyrroles (I and II) of the porphyrin ring. Its structure has been confirmed by NMR spectroscopy and total chemical synthesis.117 Haem d\\(_1\\) can be removed from the protein to give an inactive semi-apo protein; activity can be restored by reconstitution with the haem group, or to a much lesser extent, a-type haem.118 1.5.2 Properties of the haem groups in cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) Haem groups and their ligands are fundamental determinants of the catalytic properties of enzymes like cytochrome cd\\(_1\\). The ligands to the haems are amino acid residues from the polypeptide chain; they control access of the substrate and the electrochemistry of the reaction by modulating the reduction potential of the haem. Cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) has been investigated by numerous spectroscopic methods, including UV-visible spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and magnetic circular dichroism (MCD), from which models have been developed to explain the observed spin states and absorption features of the haem groups. In addition, a number of haem redox potentials have been measured for the enzyme. In fully oxidised cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) both haems are in a low spin state, indicating that they are hexacoordinate. Reduction causes the d\\(_1\\) haem to become high spin indicating that it has lost an axial ligand.119 This implies that the d\\(_1\\) haem is the site of nitrite binding and a number of ligands have been used to probe this binding-site, including azide, imidazole,120 cyanide121 and carbon monoxide.122 Similar behaviour has been noted for the periplasmic cytochrome c peroxidase enzyme of P. denitrificans, in which peroxide access at the catalytic site is thought to be blocked by a sixth axial ligand until the electron receiving haem group is fully reduced; this would prevent partial reduction of hydrogen peroxide to more reactive oxygen species.123 The identity of the ligands to the haems has taken a long time to resolve and apparently conflicting results have been reported for different cytochromes cd\\(_1\\). Low temperature MCD and EPR spectra of the Ps. aeruginosa enzyme in the oxidised state suggest histidine-methionine ligation at the c-haem and possibly bis-histidine ligation at the d\\(_1\\) haem.124 This is also the case for Ps. stutzeri.125 In contrast, EPR and Mössbauer spectroscopy of the enzyme from Th. denitrificans suggested bis-histidine ligation at both haems,126 whilst the T. pantotropha crystal structure (Section 1.5.3.1) has bis-histidine at the c haem and an unusual histidine-tyrosine at the d\\(_1\\) haem.127 Midpoint redox potentials of the haems have been reported for Ps. aeruginosa by several groups, with some disagreement. The values reported to date are summarised in Table 1.2. Table 1.2: Standard reduction potentials reported by other workers of the haem groups in cytochrome cd\\(_1\\). The figures for the difference between the midpoint redox potentials of the c and d\\(_1\\) haems are given where this measurement was the intention of the experiment, rather than a direct measurement of the two values. The pH at which the reduction potential was measured is reported where it differs from pH 7.0.

The c haem value seems the more consistent of the two; for Ps. aeruginosa this is estimated at around +288 mV (pH 7.0). The d\\(_1\\) value has been extrapolated from data used to measure the difference between the two haems and has been variously estimated as being between 25 and 70 mV lower. For the enzyme from M. magnetotacticum (which may be an atypical member of the family), the c and d\\(_1\\) values are estimated as +191 and +180 mV respectively.114 The corresponding values reported for Pseudomonas nautica strain 617 cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) are +234 mV and +199 mV (pH 7.6).136 The c haem in the semi-apo form of T. pantotropha cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) has been estimated as +243 mV (Koppenhöfer and Ferguson, unpublished work). The values are in the expected range given that the c haem is expected to receive electrons from donors of potentials around +250 mV, though the d\\(_1\\) values are somewhat lower than expected given that electrons are thought to flow from the c to the d\\(_1\\) haem. 1.5.3 Folding and conformation of cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) At present seven primary sequences of cytochromes cd\\(_1\\) are known, from the organisms Pseudomonas aeruginosa,137 Pseudomonas stutzeri Zobell,138 Pseudomonas stutzeri JM300,139 Paracoccus denitrificans IFO 12442,140 Paracoccus denitrificans PD1222,141 Alcaligenes eutrophus H16142 and Thiosphaera pantotropha (this work, Chapter 3). The first to be obtained was from Ps. aeruginosa and secondary structure predictions for this protein indicated that it contained two domains; a predominantly \\(\\alpha\\) helical N-terminal portion (including the c-haem region) and folds of largely \\(\\beta\\)-sheet towards the carboxy terminus.137 Further evidence of a two domain structure was obtained from partial digests with the alkaline serine protease subtilisin, which indicated that a dimer containing only d\\(_1\\) haem could be obtained.143 Circular dichroism spectroscopy using the Ps. aeruginosa enzyme indicated that the proportions of \\(\\alpha\\) helix and \\(\\beta\\)-sheet in the oxidised enzyme were 16% and 48% respectively, with a change on reduction to 35% \\(\\beta\\)-sheet.144 Conformational changes have been observed when the enzyme is reduced, although the precise character of these changes is unknown. In addition to a decrease in \\(\\beta\\)-sheet content the radius of gyration decreases as measured by small angle X-ray scattering,145 the thermal stability of the protein decreases146 and crystals of cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) crack on reduction.147 These observations point to some kind of rearrangement in quaternary structure with a change in redox state. The orientation and relative position of the haem groups has long been a contentious issue. A slow electron transfer rate between the haems as observed by some groups suggested that they may be quite far apart. These data are contradicted by fluorescence quenching studies which indicated that the haems were grouped at one end of a subunit148 and by the recently obtained structure of the T. pantotropha enzyme (Section 1.5.3.1). In the latter case, the haems are at a relative angle of about 60° and the iron-iron distance between haems within a subunit is 20.6 Å.127 1.5.3.1 Crystal structure of the T. pantotropha enzyme Cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) from Ps. aeruginosa was first isolated over thirty years ago. Crystallisation of the enzyme was reported almost immediately149 but although other groups have also obtained crystals (147, tegoni_crystallization_1994), none of this work has led to a published X-ray structure. However, the crystal structure of cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) in the oxidised state from T. pantotropha has recently been determined (Figure 1.4). Figure 1.4: Crystal structure of cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) in the oxidised form from T. pantotropha. Taken from Fülöp et al. (1995).127 (a) shows the dimeric molecule with the \\(\\alpha\\)-helical c-haem domain at the top and the \\(\\beta\\)-propeller d\\(_1\\) haem domain below. (b) shows the d\\(_1\\) haem domains of each subunit from below, clearly illustrating how the eight-fold \\(\\beta\\)-propeller structure forms a channel to bind the d\\(_1\\) haem. The chain of each subunit is coloured from blue (N-terminus) to red (C-terminus). The T. pantotropha structure was initially determined at a resolution of 1.55 \\(\\unicode{x212b}\\) from diffraction data and using the primary sequence of the P. denitrificans PD1222 protein as a guide.127 The latter sequence was assumed to be highly homologous to that of the protein from T. pantotropha and this has been shown subsequently to be the case (Chapter 3). The crystal space group contains a dimer with each monomer organised in two domains, as predicted by earlier studies. The smaller domain is predominantly \\(\\alpha\\)-helical, binds the c haem and resembles a Class I fold to some degree, though with some significant differences. The ligands to this haem are His-17 and His-69; this is rather unexpected as bis-histidine ligation is normally associated with low redox potential,150 whereas the c haem is thought to have a redox potential in the +250 mV range. The larger domain is an eight-bladed \\(\\beta\\)-propeller structure, a fold previously identified in methanol dehydrogenase.151 Propeller structures with fewer blades are also seen in methylamine dehydrogenase (seven blades)152 and neuraminidase (six blades).153 The central channel of this structure contains the d\\(_1\\) haem, which is ligated by His-200 and interestingly, by Tyr-25. Not only is this an unusual haem ligand, but it originates in the c haem domain; hence although separate, there is a distinct structural link between the domains. There are also a large number of important hydrogen bonds at the domain interface, and between subunits. The structure answers some of the earlier questions about haem position and environment. The two haem types are at an angle of about 60° to each other within a monomer and separated by an iron-iron distance of 20.6 \\(\\unicode{x212b}\\). The haem edge-edge distance in a monomer is 11.0 \\(\\unicode{x212b}\\). Haem distances between subunits are even larger; c haem iron-iron is 42.4 \\(\\unicode{x212b}\\). c haem-d\\(_1\\) haem is 47.0 \\(\\unicode{x212b}\\) and d\\(_1\\) haem iron-iron is 50.5 \\(\\unicode{x212b}\\), with no edges closer than 38.5 \\(\\unicode{x212b}\\). This would seem to rule out a simple iron-iron electron transfer mechanism and also discounts a binuclear haem binding site for oxygen reduction. The reported crystal structure, in combination with more recent work on reduced crystals of the enzyme and previous mechanistic studies, has allowed the development of a model for nitrite reduction which is discussed in the next section. 1.5.4 Kinetic and mechanistic studies of the enzyme The mechanism of nitrite reduction and electron transfer in cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) has been investigated by a number of methods. Classical enzymological studies have been limited by the fact that the product of nitrite reduction, nitric oxide, is a potent inhibitor of the enzyme and may also bind to the haem groups of donor proteins used in the assay system; this leads to rather complex patterns of product inhibition and rate equations (154,).155 However, a considerable amount of information has been gained from isotopic labelling techniques, spectroscopy and fast kinetic methods and data so obtained, combined with structural information, have led to a coherent model for nitrite reduction (Figure 1.5). Figure 1.5: Proposed mechanism for nitrite reduction by cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) from Thiosphaera pantotropha (Fülöp et al., 1995).127 (a) Nitrite binds at the reduced d\\(_1\\) haem which is pentacoordinate, displacing a water molecule. (b) His-345 and His-388 act as proton donors, allowing the abstraction of an oxygen atom from bound nitrite. (c) This leaves nitric oxide bound at the oxidised d\\(_1\\) haem. (d) Bound NO is then displaced by replacement with Tyr-25. The d\\(_1\\) haem is re-reduced by an electron from the c-haem, displacing Tyr-25 and allowing the cycle to begin again. Electrons from donor proteins are believed to enter the enzyme at the c haem.156 This is followed by an intramolecular electron transfer to the d\\(_1\\) haem. Reduction of this haem causes the loss of one of its axial ligands, allowing productive binding of nitrite. Isotope exchange studies have shown that the nitrite ion is protonated, then dehydrated to give an enzyme-bound nitrosyl intermediate.157 Some earlier exchange studies also indicated that a substantial amount of reaction product was nitrous oxide;158 however this has now been discounted as an artefact of the assay system, as P. denitrificans cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) assayed using isoascorbate as electron donor generates stoichiometric amounts of nitric oxide from nitrite.159 A bound Fe(III)-NO+ intermediate would not be detectable by EPR, but has recently been observed by FTIR spectroscopy.160 Furthermore, stopped-flow kinetic studies show that the first observable species is enzyme-bound nitric oxide at the oxidised d\\(_1\\) haem, with the c haem reduced.161 It is notable that in this assay system, a slow intramolecular electron transfer from the c haem to the d\\(_1\\) haem occurs, giving fully-reduced NO-bound enzyme as the final product. Bound NO has also been observed by EPR.162 This implies that the protonation/dehydration step is very fast and is followed by rapid oxidation of the d\\(_1\\) haem. The c haem is also re-reduced rapidly by a second electron; this rate is increased by the presence of NO at the d\\(_1\\) haem.161 In T. pantotropha cytochrome cd\\(_1\\), Tyr-25 is proposed to be the axial ligand which leaves the d\\(_1\\) haem on reduction. This ligand is then proposed to “swing back,” displacing the nitric oxide molecule from the oxidised d\\(_1\\) haem. Such a scheme would mean that NO had to be displaced before the d\\(_1\\) haem could be reduced by the second electron from the c haem (in contrast to);161 this makes mechanistic sense as normally, Fe(II)-NO complexes are very stable, with a half-life for dissociation of the NO in the region of days.163 This could still allow for the slow intramolecular electron transfer rate observed in some stop-flow experiments which has been assigned as the rate-limiting step;161 the electron would have to “wait” at the c haem for ligand reorganisation around the haem d\\(_1\\) co-ordination sphere. However, the observed intramolecular transfer rate may vary according to the precise experimental method; more recent work using the technique of pulse radiolysis suggests that it may not be as slow as was previously thought.164 Although the scheme outlined above is very plausible and well-supported by evidence, there are still several issues to be resolved. One of these is the precise nature of the enzyme cycle; recently it has been shown that on reduction, the c haem of cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) from T. pantotropha changes from bis-histidine to histidine-methionine ligation.165 Thus it may be that the fully-oxidised form of the enzyme is an artefact of purification and that during the catalytic cycle in vivo, the completely oxidised state is not regenerated. Another problem is relating mechanistic data concerning the enzyme from different sources to the crystal structure of the enzyme from T. pantotropha, particularly as mounting spectroscopic evidence indicates that axial haem ligation does seem genuinely to differ between cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) enzymes from different species; this point is discussed more fully in Chapter 3. 1.6 Genetic analyses of denitrification As outlined in the previous sections, a large number of genes involved in denitrification have been mapped and sequenced from several bacterial species. The first of these was the structural gene for nitrous oxide reductase, nosZ, from Ps. stutzeri Zobell; the gene was isolated using Tn5 transposon mutagenesis and analysis of mutants deficient in denitrifying growth.166 Subsequent cloning and sequencing of the flanking DNA led to the discovery of a large cluster of over 30 denitrification genes in this organism, spanning over 30 kb.95 Other workers have built on this approach by screening digested genomic DNA in different organisms using oligonucleotide probes for specific denitrification genes, isolating large hybridising fragments and sequencing. In this way, similar denitrification gene clusters have been identified in Ps. aeruginosa and P. denitrificans. Maps of the largest contiguous clusters as presently known are shown in Figure 1.6. Figure 1.6: Denitrification gene clusters in Ps. stutzeri Zobell, Ps. aeruginosa and P. denitrificans PD1222. Loci within the clusters that contain genes for nitrite- (nir), nitric oxide- (nor) and nitrous oxide- (nos) reduction are indicated. Genes in these regions are labelled with single letters. Numbered genes are open reading frames that have not been designated a gene name. Homologous genes that are found in all three clusters are indicated by identical shading; the structural genes for nitrite reductase (nirS) and nitric oxide reductase (norCB) are shaded black. Note that a gene downstream of norD designated fnrD in Ps. stutzeri Zobell is thought to be a homologue of dnr (Ps. aeruginosa) and nnr (P. denitrificans), Zumft and Körner (1997)167 but its sequence has not yet been reported. The figure was compiled from sequence data contained in the following GenBank accession numbers: Ps. stutzeri Zobell Z69589, 250198, X56813, X53676, Z13988, S41769, X65277, Z17423, S51580, Z73914, Z28384; Ps. aeruginosa D50473, D38133, D37883, X16452, D50019, D84475; P. denitrificans U28078, U05002, U17435. Additional data for P. denitrificans was derived from de Boer (1996).168 Knowledge of these gene sequences has allowed analysis of the putative gene products using a range of methods. Some of these are theoretical; for instance the sequence can be analysed for known motifs (such as the CXXCH c haem binding motif), or subjected to computer-based methods which may predict properties such as sub-cellular location, the presence of a periplasmic targeting sequence or the number of transmembrane helices in a membrane protein. Database searching may also reveal possible homologues whose function is already known. All of these methods have been applied to the genes of denitrification. In general, experimental verification of gene function lags behind the sequencing effort. However, some progress has been made in this area. The commonest approach is to inactivate the gene of interest, usually by inserting an antibiotic resistance cassette into the gene by homologous recombination, and then to look for phenotypic effects under denitrifying growth conditions. This approach has the disadvantage that it may have polar effects on genes downstream of the target gene, but such effects can normally be recognised by complementation experiments. Using the methods outlined above, a number of similarities in the denitrification gene clusters of P. denitrificans, Ps. stutzeri and Ps. aeruginosa are apparent, that can be summarised as follows. All three clusters contain the structural genes for nitric oxide reductase, norCB, and nitrite reductase, nirS, quite close to each other. In addition, the larger Ps. stutzeri cluster contains the nitrous oxide reductase gene, nosZ, and associated genes nosDFY, which are thought to be involved in biosynthesis of the enzyme. The nosZ gene has also been sequenced in P. denitrificans and appears to be associated with other nos genes as in Ps. stutzeri. Each organism contains a set of homologous genes that tend to be associated with the structural gene for a denitrification enzyme and appear to be involved with its biosynthesis. In P. denitrificans, the genes downstream of nirS, nirECFD, have all been inactivated by insertional mutagenesis and this results in a cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) that lacks d\\(_1\\) haem; hence these genes are assigned a role in haem d\\(_1\\) biosynthesis.141 Genes of this type that are conserved between the three clusters include nirF (a putative “scaffold” protein for haem d\\(_1\\) assembly), nirC (a small c-type cytochrome) and nirE (a S-adenosylmethionine uroporphyrinogen (III) C-methyl transferase). A third class of genes encodes putative electron transport proteins and these tend to be less highly conserved between species. Examples include nirM, which encodes the Class I cytochrome c\\(_{551}\\) in Ps. aeruginosa169 and nirT, encoding a membrane-bound tetrahaem cytochrome c in Ps. stutzeri.138 The latter protein is not found in the other denitrification clusters, but has a homologue, napC, in the periplasmic nitrate reductase operon of T. pantotropha. Each cluster contains several genes that appear to be involved in the regulation of denitrification. Predominant amongst these are members of the FNR family of proteins, discussed more fully in Section 1.7.1. Binding sites for these proteins are also detectable upstream of several denitrification operons. In addition, two other regulatory proteins are of note. One of these is nirQ170 (designated norQ in P. denitrificans).171 Inactivation of nirQ abolishes nitrite and nitric oxide reduction in vivo though the effects are complex; in Ps. stutzeri nitric oxide reductase becomes expressed to a two-fold higher degree and nitrite reductase retains in vitro activity. NirQ has some sequence similarity to NtrC, part of a two-component regulatory system which is linked to RNA polymerase containing the alternative sigma factor \\(\\sigma^{54}\\). The other protein is nosR172 (with a second homologue, nirI in P. denitrificans, de Boer et al. 1994). This is predicted to be a membrane-bound protein and may possess an iron-sulphur cluster. Inactivation of nosR in Ps. stutzeri results in the loss of nitrous oxide reductase and in a P. denitrificans nirI mutant, the nirS promoter is inactivated and cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) is absent (de Boer, 1996). Finally, there are a number of genes to which no function can be assigned, or that do not appear to be involved in denitrification. One such example is nirJ from P. denitrificans, insertional mutagenesis of which has no effect on anaerobic growth.141 Other examples include some recently sequenced open reading frames in Ps. stutzeri, such as orf247 (a short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase) and orf57, which has homology to a hypothetical E. coli protein, YEBC.173 The main feature of the denitrification gene clusters identified to date is that they contain homologous genes, but the gene order and content of the clusters are not conserved. For instance the nor genes are upstream of the nir operon in Ps. aeruginosa and P. denitrificans, but are downstream in Ps. stutzeri. Similar genes are also often transcribed in different directions amongst the three clusters. This has led to the description of a “mosaic” gene organisation in these clusters167 and supports a recent proposal that gene order is not conserved in evolution.174 A final feature of note is that genes for the membrane-bound and periplasmic nitrate reductases, nar and nap respectively, are not found within the large denitrification gene clusters described above. 1.7 Regulation of denitrification Respiratory N-oxide reduction is an anaerobic process and its regulation might therefore be expected to be under the control of both oxygen tension and ambient N-oxide concentration. Both of these aspects have been investigated, particularly in E. coli due to its genetic amenability, though similar systems are becoming apparent in the denitrifying bacteria. It is now clear that the control systems involved act largely at the level of transcription. Several systems comprising DNA-binding transcriptional activators (or repressors), and the sequence motifs to which they bind, are now understood in some detail and are described in the following sections. 1.7.1 Anaerobic response regulators: the FNR family The anaerobic regulator FNR was first identified in mutants of E. coli, which were deficient in anaerobic growth on fumarate and nitrite.175 Complementation analysis of these mutants revealed an open reading frame encoding the FNR protein. The protein has a subunit mass of around 28 kDa and shows high homology to the cyclic AMP receptor protein.176 The most highly conserved regions are a DNA-binding helix-turn-helix motif, an N-terminal \\(\\beta\\)-roll and an RNA polymerase contact site. However, the FNR protein contains an N-terminal extension with four cysteine residues, and a further internal cysteine at position 122. The function of the cysteines is to bind iron; the activity of FNR can be correlated to its iron content, which varies with the method of purification, and can be reconstituted to some degree.177 More recently, it has been suggested that the N-terminal region forms an iron-sulphur cluster, which is labile in the presence of oxygen.178 FNR is a transcriptional regulator which can act under anaerobic conditions in either a positive or a negative fashion, depending on the target gene. It has been suggested that FNR senses oxygen directly, possibly through a different binding affinity for Fe(II) and Fe(III) becker_o2_1996, but FNR-dependent promoter activity can also be stimulated by varying the redox potential in the cell,179 suggesting it may react more indirectly to the redox state. However, currently the consensus of opinion supports the idea that the inactive form of FNR is generated as a result of the destruction of its iron-sulphur cluster in the presence of oxygen.178 Under anaerobic conditions, FNR is believed to dimerise and bind to a target sequence upstream of the FNR-dependent gene. Many such gene clusters have been identified in E. coli and other bacteria; the consensus target sequence (or “FNR box”) is an inverted repeat, TTGATN\\(_4\\)ATCAA and in E. coli, this is generally centred at about -41.5 nucleotides relative to the transcription start point180 in genes that are activated by FNR. DNA-binding by FNR can then enhance transcription from the downstream promoter by contacting RNA polymerase. FNR can also negatively regulate transcription by binding at a different position and blocking RNA polymerase. The fnr gene is itself negatively auto-regulated in this way.181 Binding to the FNR box has been demonstrated by a number of methods, including DNase I footprinting182 and electrophoretic mobility shift assays.183 Having identified FNR-dependent promoters, reporter gene fusions have been employed to measure induction or repression at the promoter under different growth conditions.184 Site-directed mutagenesis has been used extensively to determine both the key amino acids in the FNR protein and the nucleotides at its binding site. This work has identified the conserved regions in the N-terminal cysteines of FNR, the RNA polymerase contact site and the DNA-binding domain. Mutations in residues 81-87 of the E. coli FNR protein can give a protein which is competent for DNA binding but not transcriptional activation, establishing the concept of a positive control “patch” which interacts with RNA polymerase.185 In this region, Gly-85 and Gln-88 are invariant but residues 86 and 87 vary in other members of the FNR family (see below). Site-directed mutagenesis has also established the residues thought to be critical in the DNA-binding domain; this is the most highly conserved region of the FNR family.186 A number of FNR homologues have now been identified that fall into several distinct groups (see below) but intriguingly, the consensus FNR box appears to be very similar regardless of which FNR homologue it binds. There may be some promiscuous binding between FNR proteins and their target sequences, but on the whole the homologues do not appear to substitute for one another in vivo, suggesting rather subtle differences in the specificity of the different FNR-like proteins. However, only two amino acid substitutions in FNR allows binding to a CRP consensus site (and vice-versa,),187 and only three base changes in the FNR binding site allow binding by the CRP protein.188 Much of the detailed biochemical and genetic characterisation of FNR has been carried out in E. coli, the organism in which it was first identified. More recently, a number of FNR homologues have been identified in several other species of bacteria and the FNR binding consensus has been found upstream of a large number of open reading frames. Many of these FNR homologues have been cloned and sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis of the sequences has revealed a superfamily of proteins (Figure 1.7). Figure 1.7: Unrooted phylogenetic tree of the FNR family of transcriptional activator proteins. Protein sequences that showed a high similarity to the FNR protein from E. coli were retrieved from the GenBank database and aligned using the program Clustal W (Thompson et al. 1994).189 The phylogenetic tree was constructed by the method of neighbour-joining (Saitou and Nei, 1987)190 and analysed by bootstrapping (Felsenstein, 1985)191 using 1000 trials. The final tree was displayed using the program Treeview (Page, 1996).192 More details of these methods are given in Chapter 3. The tree shows that the FNR family falls into three main groups (van Spanning et al., 1997):193 (A) the FNR subgroup, (B) the FixK subgroup and (C) the NNR subgroup. The FixK subgroup can be subdivided further into two groups, depending on the presence of an N-terminal cysteine cluster (van Spanning et al., 1997).193 The NtcA proteins (Frías et al. 1993)194 also cluster together within the NNR subgroup.

This grouping reflects the different functional domains within the proteins. Group A are the prototype FNR proteins containing the N-terminal cysteine cluster, RNA polymerase contact site, dimerisation domain and DNA-binding helix-turn-helix motif. Group B1 also contains all of these domains, but in groups B2 and C (the FixK and NNR subfamilies), the cysteine cluster is not present and there are differences in the putative RNA polymerase contact site. The lack of an iron-binding cysteine cluster is intriguing, as it is this that is proposed to respond to anaerobiosis in the FNR proteins. FixK and NNR clearly do respond to anaerobiosis in some way, as shown by strains carrying mutations in these genes,201,202 but the mechanism of the response is at present not clear. The differences in the RNA polymerase contact site have led some groups to suggest that the promoter regions of genes controlled in this manner bind an alternative sigma factor on RNA polymerase.203 This is discussed further in Chapter 7. In many cases different FNR homologues have been found in the same organism; for instance in P. denitrificans, FnrP is thought to regulate transcription of membrane-bound nitrate reductase, cytochrome c peroxidase and cbb\\(_3\\) cytochrome oxidase, whilst NNR controls the nitrite and nitric oxide reductases.193 Similarly in Ps. aeruginosa, the homologues ANR and DNR both seem to control denitrification genes,197 whilst in Ps. stutzeri, mutation of FnrA (an ANR homologue) has no effect on denitrifying growth, suggesting the presence of a second FNR-like protein.204 1.7.2 The ArcA/B system In E. coli a second system for oxygen-regulated transcriptional control is known, the ArcA/B system. This is a two-component sensor/regulator signal transduction system, of a type commonly found where response to an environmental signal is required.205 ArcB is a transmembrane protein, with a periplasmic N-terminal sensor domain and a cytoplasmic C-terminal transmitter domain.206 ArcA is a cytoplasmic protein, with an N-terminal receiver domain and a C-terminal DNA-binding domain.207 The action of the ArcA/B system has been recently reviewed in Unden et al..208 Under low oxygen tension, the transmembrane protein ArcB responds indirectly to a signal at the cytoplasmic membrane (possibly the UQH\\(_2\\)/UQ ratio) and is autophosphorylated at His-292 by ATP. The phosphate is transferred intramolecularly to Asp-576, followed by a second phosphorylation at His-292. This double-phosphorylated species is then competent to phosphorylate the cytoplasmic ArcA protein at an N-terminal Asp residue. Once phosphorylated, ArcA becomes active and can bind DNA upstream of the genes to be regulated. ArcA-P acts for most genes as a repressor, blocking transcription under anaerobic conditions. Genes affected in this way include those encoding the citric acid cycle enzymes. ArcA-P can also act as an activator; the E. coli cydAB operon encoding cytochrome d oxidase possesses two ArcA-P binding sites upstream of its promoter, which have been identified by DNase I footprinting.209 This work has lead to the identification of a consensus ArcA-P binding site. LacZ reporter gene fusions have been used to show that the Arc A/B system exerts its effects in the range 10-20% air saturation, whereas Fnr functions in the 0-10% range.210 Hence in E. coli the two systems co-ordinate the control of respiratory gene expression to ensure optimal use of oxygen as environmental conditions change. Unlike FNR the ArcA/B system is only well characterised in E. coli and to date, none of the denitrification genes have been shown to be under ArcA/B control. However, the system is important as a complementary response to the FNR system and it is possible that something similar will be found in denitrifying bacteria. 1.7.3 Sensors of nitrate and nitrite In E. coli nitrate and nitrite are sensed by two, interacting, two-component regulatory systems known as NarX/L and NarQ/P.211,212 These function in a similar fashion to the ArcA/B system described earlier. NarX and NarQ are transmembrane proteins, possessing a periplasmic domain which can sense nitrate or nitrite. A region within this domain termed the “P-box” has been shown by site-directed mutagenesis to be involved in nitrate/nitrite sensing.213 This results in an autophosphorylation at the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain, which in turn goes on to phosphorylate the cytoplasmic component, NarL or NarP. Activated NarL/P can then go on to bind to a target DNA sequence and enhance or repress transcription of nitrate/nitrite dependent genes. A consensus site, the “NarL heptamer,” has been proposed with the recognition sequence TACYNKT (where Y=C or T, N=any nucleotide and K=A or C).214 The NarL heptamer appears as a single heptamer, a direct or inverted repeat, in either orientation and apparently between +20 and -220 nucleotides from the transcription start site. The interaction between the homologous NarX/L and NarQ/P systems is quite complex; essentially it seems that nitrate stimulates NarX/Q to phosphorylate NarL/P, nitrite stimulates NarQ to phosphorylate both NarL and NarP and finally that NarX can act to dephosphorylate NarL-phosphate in the absence of nitrate.212 No analogous system has yet been identified in the denitrifying bacteria, but all four N oxides have been reported to increase the expression of at least one reductase, particularly in Ps. stutzeri and Ps. aeruginosa. In the latter organism, expression of the cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) nitrite reductase appears to rely more on the presence of nitrate or nitrite than on anaerobiosis.215 Levels of nitrous oxide reductase in Ps. stutzeri are also regulated by nitrate, nitrous oxide and anaerobiosis.216 There also appears to be a regulatory link between the nitrite and nitric oxide reductases. In Ps. stutzeri, mutation in nitric oxide reductase reduces nitrite reductase activity, though its expression level is similar. The converse is true for mutants in nitrite reductase.76 This implies that nitric oxide may induce its reductase and that there is a functional coupling between these two enzymes. It seems likely that control of denitrification will prove to be a complex process, with several hierarchical levels that act to “fine-tune” the response to changing environmental conditions. This is already becoming apparent in the systems described previously for E. coli. One example of a complex promoter system is the focApfl operon, encoding pyruvate formate lyase and the focA gene product. This system is regulated by both ArcA and FNR, which can act at several different promoters in the operon. One promoter, P6A, overlaps an FNR-dependent promoter, modulating its activity by competition for FNR- and RNA polymerase-binding.217 There are also several examples of promoters that are regulated by the FNR, Arc A/B and NarX/L components.218 Although the regulation of denitrification is known to occur primarily at the level of transcription, transcriptional analysis of denitrification genes has been reported in relatively few cases. Northern blot analysis has been reported for the norBC genes of Ps. stutzeri which are co-transcribed,76 and for the nosZ gene which is apparently under the control of 6 alternate promoters.219 Also in Ps. stutzeri, transcription of the nirS gene for cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) nitrite reductase occurs as two transcripts, nirS and nirST, and is controlled by anaerobiosis and nitrate.220 The fnrA gene from this organism is also known to be transcribed as a single 0.85 kb species.76 Induction of the mRNAs for nitrate, nitrite and nitrous oxide reductases in P. denitrificans during the switch to anaerobiosis has also been reported.56 More commonly, transcriptional and translational features are inferred from inspection of the gene sequence; hence in P. denitrificans, the nirE and nirC genes have overlapping stop and start codons,141 implying that they are co-translated, whilst stem-loop analysis of the nir operon in Ps. aeruginosa has been used to suggest that the 11 genes nirSMCFDLGHJEN are transcribed on a polycistronic mRNA.221 1.8 Aims of the present work At the outset of this project the X-ray crystal structure of cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) nitrite reductase from T. pantotropha had been determined from diffraction data and the P. denitrificans PD1222 sequence, with no complete protein sequence from the T. pantotropha protein. The initial aim of the project was to clone the structural gene, nirS, from T. pantotropha, so as to obtain the polypeptide sequence and refine this crystal structure. Mapping and sequencing of the nirS gene and surrounding regions was also essential for subsequent DNA manipulations. It was also of interest to determine whether the organisation of the nir cluster is similar to that of the closely-related P. denitrificans. Having cloned the nirS gene, the next aim would be to investigate several expression systems for the enzyme. This work would involve cloning the gene into a suitableexpression vector and trying to transform a number of heterologous hosts, to determine which ones expressed the protein most efficiently. As the d\\(_1\\) haem group is unique to cytochrome cd\\(_1\\), it would also be advantageous to use heterologous hosts which are able to synthesise this group, so as to express the active holoprotein. Development of a suitable expression system is an essential prerequisite for future site-directed mutagenesis studies. Finally, transcriptional regulation of the nirS and associated genes is of interest. Knowledge of this process may help to understand the expression of the protein, so a third aim of the project was to investigate the mRNA transcribed from the nirS gene, using methods such as Northern blotting and determination of the transcription start site. This work was expected to help to define novel promoter regions in the denitrification genes of P. denitrificans and T. pantotropha, and to provide insight into the transcriptional regulation of denitrification.

Large cultures (20 l) were inoculated with 1 l of late-exponential culture and grown for 5 hours at 30 °C, whilst sparging with air at a rate of 2-3 1 min\\(^{-1}\\), then for 6 hours with no aeration. This cycle was repeated once, giving a total growth time of 22 hours, after which the cells were harvested at an A\\(_{650}\\) of around 0.9. 2.2.6 E. coli anaerobic minimal medium E. coli JM83 was grown anaerobically using a medium based on that described by Pope and Cole (1982).231 Concentration (mM) KH\\(_2\\)PO\\(_4\\) 33 K\\(_2\\)HPO\\(_4\\) 46 trisodium citrate 1.7 (NH\\(_4\\))\\(_2\\)SO\\(_4\\) 7.6 Fumaric acid pH 7.0 40 NaNO\\(_2\\) 5 Trace metals Concentration (\\(\\mu\\)M) Na\\(_2\\)SeO\\(_4\\).10H\\(_2\\)O 1 Na\\(_2\\)MoO\\(_4\\).2H\\(_2\\)O 1 Sulphur-free trace metals solution232 was added at 1 ml l\\(^{-1}\\). Concentration in stock trace elements solution (mM) MgCl\\(_2\\):6H\\(_2\\)O 403 MnCl\\(_2\\):4H\\(_2\\)O 50.5 FeCl\\(_3\\).6H\\(_2\\)O 14.8 CaCl\\(_2\\).6H\\(_2\\)O 4.6 The medium also contained 0.4% v/v glycerol and 5% v/v Luria-Bertani medium (Section 2.2.1). Overnight starter cultures grown aerobically in LB medium were inoculated at a dilution of 1:100 and the cultures were incubated at 37 °C in completely filled bottles without shaking. 2.2.7 Growth on solid medium Strains were grown on plates containing the media described above using the addition of 1.5% w/v bacteriological agar. 2.2.8 Antibiotics and other selective additions to media Antibiotics were used to select for cells carrying plasmids or to counter-select for one organism against another, at the following concentrations (in \\(\\mu\\)g ml\\(^{-1}\\)): ampicillin (100), kanamycin (25 for E. coli, 100 for T. pantotropha), rifampicin (100), spectinomycin (25 for E. coli, 100 for T. pantotropha), streptomycin (50 for E. coli, 100 for T. pantotropha), carbenicillin (250). Lead nitrate was also used at a concentration of 1 mM to select for T. pantotropha following conjugative transfer of plasmids from E. coli S17-1 (Section 2.5.20). Ps. aeruginosa was selected for following the same procedure using Pseudomonas selective medium supplements (Oxoid). Plates used for this purpose contained 200 \\(\\mu\\)g ml\\(^{-1}\\) of cetrimide and 15 \\(\\mu\\)g ml\\(^{-1}\\) of sodium nalidixate. For blue-white selection of plasmids by \\(\\alpha\\)-complementation in E. coli, isopropylthio-\\(\\beta\\)-D-galactoside (IPTG) and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-\\(\\beta\\)-D-galactoside (X-Gal) were used at concentrations of 1 mM and 100 mM, respectively. IPTG was also used at concentrations of 0.5-1 mM to induce transcription from plasmids containing the tac promoter.233 2.3 Protein biochemistry techniques 2.3.1 Preparation of total soluble extracts Soluble extracts for protein analysis were prepared from cells by sonication or by a freeze-thaw lysozyme procedure.94 For sonication, cells were grown to mid-exponential phase, harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0. The cell suspension was sonicated in an ice bath by 12 rounds of sonication (MSE sonicator tuned to 7-8 \\(\\mu\\)m amplitude) for a duration of 30 seconds, separated by 30 second pauses to prevent overheating. Broken cells were then ultracentrifuged for 45 minutes at 183 000 g, 4 °C, to pellet membrane material. Soluble extracts were also prepared from Ps. aeruginosa using a freeze-thaw lysozyme procedure. Following centrifugation, the harvested cells were resuspended in 5 ml of Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, per litre of original culture and lysozyme was added to a concentration of 1 mg ml\\(^{-1}\\). The sample was incubated for 10 minutes at 37 °C, then frozen at -70 °C for 30 minutes. The cells were then thawed at room temperature and the cycle was repeated once more. The sample was incubated with a few crystals of DNase for 10 minutes at 37 °C, then centrifuged at 40 000 g for 30 minutes at 4 °C. The supernatant was filtered once through Whatman 3MM paper and used as the final total soluble extract. 2.3.2 Preparation of periplasmic extracts Periplasmic fractions were prepared from cells of T. pantotropha by the method of spheroplasting. Cells were grown to late exponential phase, harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 20 ml per litre of original culture of 0.5 M sucrose, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 3 mM EDTA. Lysozyme was added to a concentration of 1 mg ml\\(^{-1}\\) and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 minutes. The mixture was then centrifuged at 18 000 g for 30 minutes, producing a pellet of spheroplasts and a supernatant containing periplasmic proteins. Ps. aeruginosa was spheroplasted in a similar way, except EDTA was omitted and the incubation at 37 °C was for 1 hour. 2.3.3 Protein purification All protein purification was carried out at 4 °C. Column sizes, loading capacity and flow rates were determined according to information in Scopes (1987).234 Flow rates were controlled with a peristaltic pump (P-1, Pharmacia Biotech) and fractions were collected using a RediFrac fraction collector (Pharmacia Biotech). 2.3.3.1 Ion exchange chromatography Ion-exchange chromatography was employed not only as a first step in the purification of cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) from Thiosphaera pantotropha but also as a general first step in all protein purifications. Extracts for purification were prepared in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0 at 4 °C. Columns of sizes 1 x 10 cm and 2.6 x 40 cm were generally used. The columns were packed with DEAE-Sepharose CL6B (Pharmacia Biotech) and equilibrated with 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 (start buffer). Extract was loaded onto the column and non-specifically bound material was washed through with 3 column volumes of start buffer. Fractions were eluted using a linear gradient of 0-400 mM NaCl in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, using a volume and fraction size appropriate to the column. 2.3.3.2 Hydrophobic interaction chromatography Cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) was further purified using hydrophobic interaction chromatography on Phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B columns (Pharmacia Biotech). Protein extracts in 50 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0 were brought to 40% saturation with (NH\\(_4\\))\\(_2\\)SO\\(_4\\) using the formula of Scopes (1987) and gently stirred at 4 °C. Columns of 1 x 10 cm were packed and equilibrated in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 40% saturated (NH\\(_4\\))\\(_2\\)SO\\(_4\\) (start buffer). Samples were loaded and washed with 3 volumes of this start buffer. Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 40-0% saturation (NH\\(_4\\))\\(_2\\)SO\\(_4\\) in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0. 2.3.3.3 Size exclusion chromatography (gel filtration) Proteins were further purified by gel filtration using columns of Sephacryl S-200 HR (Pharmacia Biotech). Columns of 2.6 x 100 cm were packed and equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl according to the manufacturer’s instructions and run at 10-20 ml h\\(^{-1}\\). Samples were concentrated to about 4 ml before application, using an Amicon ultrafiltration cell with a 10 kDa cut-off membrane. 2.3.4 Sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) Protein samples were analysed in whole cell extracts or during purification using size fractionation by SDS-PAGE. Gels of an appropriate percentage acrylamide (from a stock of acrylamide plus N, N’-methylenebisacrylamide in the ratio 30:0.8) were prepared according to Sambrook et al. (1989)235 and cast using a Mini Protean II apparatus (BioRad). Stacking gels contained 5% acrylamide, 130 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8 and 0.1% w/v SDS. Resolving gels contained 6-15% acrylamide (depending on the range of separation required), 375 mM Tris HCl pH 8.8 and 0.1% w/v SDS. Polymerisation of gels was initiated with 0.1% w/v ammonium persulphate and 0.1% v/v TEMED (N, N, N’, N’-tetramethylethylenediamine). Samples at an appropriate concentration were denatured by boiling for 5 minutes with 5 \\(\\mu\\)l of sample buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 100 mM dithiothreitol, 2% w/v SDS, 0.1% w/v bromophenol blue, 10% glycerol), in a total volume of 20 \\(\\mu\\)l, and separated at 180 V for 45 minutes. Electrophoresis buffer contained 25 mM Tris, 250 mM glycine pH 8.3, 0.1% w/v SDS. 2.3.4.1 Coomassie Blue stain for proteins After electrophoresis, total protein was detected on gels by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 (0.5% w/v), in 50% v/v methanol, 10% v/v acetic acid, for 1 hour at room temperature. Gels were destained with 30% v/v methanol, 10% v/v acetic acid, until the background was clear. For storage, gels were either vacuum-dried on filter paper at 80 °C, after soaking in 10% v/v glycerol for several hours, or dried between cellulose sheets using the Promega gel drying system. 2.3.4.2 Haem stain Following separation by SDS-PAGE, c-type cytochromes were stained for haem using the method of Goodhew et al. (1986).236 Before electrophoresis, protein samples were denatured in sample loading buffer without dithiothreitol, as this reduces the intensity of the stain. The gel was soaked in 70 ml of 0.25 M sodium acetate, pH 5.2, for 30 minutes. 30 mg of 3, 3, 5, 5°-tetramethylbenzidine dissolved in 30 ml of methanol was added and the gel was incubated for a further 30 minutes. Staining was initiated by the addition of 0.3 ml of 30% v/v hydrogen peroxide and the gel was incubated with gentle shaking in the dark. After full development, the gel was washed twice in 50 ml of 70% v/v 0.25 M sodium acetate pH 5.2, 30% v/v isopropanol and stored in water in the dark. 2.3.4.3 Western blotting Cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) from Thiosphaera pantotropha was detected immunologically after SDS PAGE by Western blotting. Protein extracts were separated on 6% acrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using semi-dry transfer buffer (50 mM Tris, 38 mM glycine pH 8.3, 0.04% w/v SDS, 20% v/v methanol) as an electrolyte in a Pharmacia LKB Novablot electroblotting apparatus. After transfer, the gel was blocked for 1 hour in PBS-A-T buffer (8.1 mM Na\\(_2\\)HPO\\(_4\\), 1.5 mM KH\\(_2\\)PO\\(_4\\) pH 7.4, 140 mM NaCl, 7.7 mM NaN\\(_3\\), 0.3% v/v Tween-20) plus 1% w/v skimmed milk powder (blocking buffer). The membrane was washed in PBS-A-T plus 0.3% w/v skimmed milk powder (wash buffer), then incubated for two hours in blocking buffer containing mouse anti-cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) antibody (obtained from Thon de Boer, Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam), at a dilution of 1/1000. The membrane was washed three times for five minutes each time with wash buffer, then incubated for two hours with anti-rabbit antibody-alkaline phosphatase conjugate, also diluted to 1/1000. After three more five minute washes in wash buffer, the membrane was washed four times with PBS-A-T buffer and equilibrated for 1 minute in TBS buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl pH 9.5, 100 mM NaCl). Bound antibody was detected colorimetrically by incubating the membrane in TBS buffer containing 10 mM MgCl\\(_2\\), 200 \\(\\mu\\)M nitroblue tetrazolium and 20 \\(\\mu\\)M 5-bromo-4 chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. Development was stopped by several washes of distilled water and membranes were stored in TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA) in the dark. 2.3.5 Determination of protein concentration Protein concentrations were estimated using the method of Bradford (1976)237 and the BioRad reagent kit. 20 \\(\\mu\\)l of diluted sample was mixed with 0.8 ml of distilled water and 0.2 ml of reagent and incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes. Absorbance at 595 nm was recorded and converted to protein concentration in mg ml\\(^{-1}\\) using a standard curve prepared with known concentrations of bovine serum albumin. 2.3.6 UV-visible spectroscopy UV and visible spectra of protein samples were recorded on a Perkin Elmer Lambda 2 spectrophotometer, interfaced to a Dell 316SX PC running Perkin Elmer spectroscopy software. 2.3.7 Assays for enzyme activity 2.3.7.1 Cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) nitrite reductase assay Nitrite reductase activity of cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) was routinely measured using reduced methyl viologen as an electron donor. Assays were performed in a 1 ml cuvette containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM methyl viologen and an aliquot of sample. The cuvette was sealed with a rubber septum, evacuated and flushed with argon. 1-2 \\(\\mu\\)l of sodium dithionite (approximately 5 mg ml\\(^{-1}\\)) was added to reduce the methyl viologen, giving a blue colour. After checking that the background rate of reduction was close to zero, the reaction was initiated by the addition of 10 mM KNO\\(_2\\). Oxidation of methyl viologen was followed by the decrease in absorbance at 600 nm over time. The rate was converted to a specific activity using the extinction coefficient for reduced methyl viologen at 600 nm (\\(\\epsilon_{600}\\)) of 13 mM\\(^{-1}\\) cm\\(^{-1}\\).238 2.3.7.2 Cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) cytochrome oxidase assay The oxidase activity of cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) from T. pantotropha was assayed using horse heart cytochrome c as an electron donor. To prepare pre-reduced cytochrome c, 35 mg of cytochrome c was dissolved in 2.5 ml of 200 mM KH\\(_2\\)PO\\(_4\\), pH 7.4, that contained 1 mg ml\\(^{-1}\\) of sodium dithionite. Excess sodium dithionite was removed by passage through a Sephadex PD-10 column, equilibrated with the same buffer. Cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) was assayed in a volume of 1 ml containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and 25 \\(\\mu\\)M of reduced cytochrome c. The assay was started with the addition of an aliquot of cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) and the oxidation of the cytochrome c was followed by the decrease in its absorbance at 550 nm. A difference extinction coefficient of 18.5 mM\\(^{-1}\\) cm\\(^{-1}\\)155 was used to calculate the rate of activity. 2.3.7.3 Cytochrome c peroxidase assay Cytochrome c peroxidase from T. pantotropha was assayed using reduced horse heart cytochrome c as an electron donor, based on the method of Gilmour et al. (1994).123 Pre-reduced cytochrome c was prepared as described in the above section. Aliquots of the sample to be assayed were incubated in a 1 ml cuvette containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 25 \\(\\mu\\)M reduced cytochrome c. The assay was initiated after 40-60 s by the addition of hydrogen peroxide to a final concentration of 18 \\(\\mu\\)M and the activity was followed by the decrease in absorbance at 550 nm, as described for the cytochrome oxidase assay. 2.3.7.4 Assay of nitrite produced by in vivo nitrite reductase activity Nitrite that had accumulated in the medium of T. pantotropha or Ps. aeruginosa cultures during denitrification was assayed colorimetrically using the method of Nicholas and Nason (1957).239 1 ml samples of the culture were centrifuged to pellet the cells and a 50 \\(\\mu\\)l aliquot of the supernatant (diluted where necessary) was mixed with 3.7 ml of 1% w/v sulphanilamide in 1 M HCl. 0.3 ml of 0.02% w/v N-(1-napthyl) ethylene diamine hydrochloride was added and the samples were incubated at room temperature for 20 minutes. The absorbance at 540 nm was recorded and the concentration of nitrite was calculated from a standard curve of known nitrite concentrations in the range 0-1 mM. 2.3.8 Chemical preparation of semi-apo cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) Haem d\\(_1\\) was removed from cytochrome cd\\(_1\\), giving the c-haem containing semi-apo enzyme, by the method of Hill and Wharton (1978).118 2 ml of purified protein (2 mg ml\\(^{-1}\\)) in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 was mixed with 18 ml of acetone containing 24 mM HCl. The solution was incubated at 37 °C for 20 minutes and centrifuged at 4000 g, 4 °C for 2 minutes. The red pellet of precipitated protein was washed twice with acetone/HCl and twice with acetone, then redissolved in 2 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 9.0, 6 M urea. This solution was dialysed overnight at 4 °C against 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0. Samples were analysed by spectroscopy in the oxidised and reduced forms to confirm the presence of only c-type haem. 2.3.9 Purification of haem d\\(_1\\) Haem d\\(_1\\) was purified during the preparation of semi-apo cytochrome cd\\(_1\\), described above. After centrifugation of the semi-apo protein, 8 volumes of the green supernatant (containing haem d\\(_1\\)) was extracted with 1 volume of 1.2 M NaOH. Haem d\\(_1\\) dissolved in the lower aqueous layer and was removed with a pipette. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 7 with 1 M HCl and the solution was stored at 4 °C in the dark. The haem concentration was estimated from the absorbance of the pyridine haemochromogen at 620 nm using an extinction coefficient of 24 mM\\(^{-1}\\) cm\\(^{-1}\\).118 2.4 Genetic techniques 2.4.1 DNA manipulation 2.4.1.1 Organic solvent extraction and precipitation of nucleic acids Nucleic acids were purified and concentrated after enzymatic manipulation by organic solvent extraction and ethanol precipitation. An equal volume of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) was mixed with the sample by vortexing and the phases were separated by centrifugation at 15 000 g for two minutes. The upper aqueous phase was mixed with 0.1 volumes of 3 M sodium acetate pH 5.2 and 2.5 volumes of cold ethanol and incubated at -70 °C for 30 minutes. Nucleic acids were pelleted by centrifugation at 15 000 g for 15 minutes, then washed with 100 \\(\\mu\\)l of ice-cold 70% v/v ethanol by centrifuging for a further five minutes. The pellet was air-dried, then redissolved in TE buffer or sterile distilled water. 2.4.1.2 Purification of plasmid DNA Plasmid DNA was purified from bacteria by three methods, depending on the quality required for subsequent experiments. For restriction digests, analysis and cloning, the alkaline lysis miniprep procedure was used.240 1.5 ml of an overnight culture was harvested in a microcentrifuge and resuspended in 300 \\(\\mu\\)l of 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 50 mM glucose, 10 mM EDTA. The cells were lysed by the addition of 600 \\(\\mu\\)l of 0.2 M NaOH, 1% w/v SDS. Protein and chromosomal DNA were then precipitated by the addition of 450 \\(\\mu\\)l of 3 M potassium acetate, 11.5 % v/v glacial acetic acid pH 4.8. The precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 15 000 g for 15 minutes. 800 \\(\\mu\\)l of supernatant was treated with 20 \\(\\mu\\)g ml\\(^{-1}\\) of DNase-free RNase A at 37 °C for 20 minutes. Plasmid DNA was precipitated with 0.8 volumes of isopropanol and pelleted by centrifugation at 15 000 g for 15 minutes. Finally, the pellet was washed with ice-cold 70% v/v ethanol by centrifugation for five minutes, drained, air-dried and redissolved in 50 \\(\\mu\\)l of TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA). Plasmid DNA was stored at -20 °C. Plasmid DNA of higher purity for sequencing was purified by either PEG precipitation241 or using the Wizard plasmid DNA purification kit (Promega). In the first method, the alkaline lysis procedure was followed up to the RNase A treatment, after which the sample was extracted once with 400 \\(\\mu\\)l of phenol:chloroform. After precipitation, washing and drying of the plasmid DNA, the pellet was redissolved in 16 \\(\\mu\\)l of sterile distilled water and thoroughly mixed with 4 \\(\\mu\\)l of 4 M NaCl and 20 \\(\\mu\\)l of 13% w/v polyethylene glycol (PEG 8000). The sample was incubated on ice for 30 minutes, then centrifuged at 15 000 g for 15 minutes to pellet the plasmid DNA. The pellet was then washed with 70% v/v ethanol, dried and redissolved in 20 \\(\\mu\\)l of sterile distilled water. The Promega Wizard kit was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cell lysis and the production of a cleared supernatant were performed much as described for the alkaline lysis miniprep. Plasmid DNA was then mixed with DNA binding resin, absorbed onto a minicolumn and washed with wash solution (80 mM potassium acetate, 8.3 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5, 40 \\(\\mu\\)M EDTA, 55% v/v ethanol). The purified plasmid DNA was eluted in 40-50 \\(\\mu\\)l of prewarmed (70 °C) TE buffer, by a brief centrifugation. 2.4.1.3 Restriction digestion of DNA Plasmid and chromosomal DNA was digested with restriction enzymes to allow cloning of DNA fragments and to analyse recombinant plasmids. Plasmid DNA was digested in a volume of 20 \\(\\mu\\)l (or 40 \\(\\mu\\)l for preparative digests), containing the appropriate restriction enzyme buffer (New England Biolabs), 5-10 units of restriction enzyme and 1 mg ml\\(^{-1}\\) of bovine serum albumin where recommended, for one hour at the correct temperature (normally 37 °C, 25 °C for SmaI). Chromosomal DNA (usually 5-10 \\(\\mu\\)g) was digested for 4-8 hours. Digestion was stopped with 25 mM Na EDTA or by heating at the recommended inactivation temperature. 2.4.1.4 Conversion of cohesive DNA ends to blunt ends using T4 DNA polymerase Cohesive DNA ends produced by restriction digestion were converted to blunt ends for cloning into plasmids digested with “blunt cutters” such as Smal or EcoRV. After digestion and inactivation of the restriction enzyme, digests were extracted with an equal volume of phenol:chloroform and precipitated. The DNA was then redissolved in 20 \\(\\mu\\)l of sterile distilled water, containing T4 polymerase buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.9, 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl\\(_2\\), 1 mM DTT, 50 \\(\\mu\\)g ml BSA), 100 \\(\\mu\\)M of each deoxynucleotide triphosphate and 3 units of T4 DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for five minutes, 15 °C for 20 minutes, then heat-inactivated at 75 °C for 10 minutes. 2.4.1.5 Dephosphorylation of plasmid DNA Vector DNA was dephosphorylated before cloning to prevent religation of the vector in difficult clonings such as those without blue-white selection (Section 2.3.8), or into sites cut with a single blunt cutting enzyme. After digestion, the volume of the reaction mixture was increased to 200 \\(\\mu\\)l with sterile distilled water and shrimp alkaline phosphatase buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.8, 10 mM MgCl\\(_2\\)) and 2 units of shrimp alkaline phosphatase (United States Biochemical) was added. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 minutes, then at 65 °C for 20 minutes to inactivate the enzyme. DNA was recovered by extraction with an equal volume of phenol:chloroform, followed by ethanol precipitation. 2.4.1.6 Ligation of DNA fragments into plasmid vectors DNA fragments with either blunt or cohesive termini were cloned into plasmid vectors using T4 DNA ligase. Ligations were performed in a volume of 20 \\(\\mu\\)l, containing ligase buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.8, 10 mM MgCl\\(_2\\), 10 mM DTT, 1 mM ATP, 25 \\(\\mu\\)g ml\\(^{-1}\\) bovine serum albumin), 400 units of T4 DNA ligase and various proportions of vector and insert DNA, to generate the optimum number of clones containing an insert. Cohesive end ligations were usually incubated at 15 °C for one hour, then at 4 °C overnight. Blunt end ligations were usually incubated at 15 °C overnight. Ligation mixtures were stored at -20 °C until used for transformation. 2.4.1.7 Agarose gel electrophoresis Restricted DNA was separated by size fractionation using agarose gel electrophoresis, for analysis of recombinant plasmids and separation of fragments for purification. After restriction, 0.1 volumes of sterile loading dye (10 mM EDTA, 50% v/v glycerol, 0.5% w/v bromophenol blue) was added. For analysis of digested plasmids, gels of 50 ml volume (106 x 78 x 6 mm) and 0.6-1.4% w/v agarose were most often used. These gels were run in TBE buffer (45 mM Tris-borate pH 8.3, 1 mM EDTA) at a constant current of 50-60 mA. For subsequent DNA purification, TAE buffer (40 mM Tris-acetate pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA) was used instead. Ethidium bromide was added to the gel and the electrophoresis buffer at a concentration of 0.2 \\(\\mu\\)g ml\\(^{-1}\\) to stain the DNA. Stained gels were viewed and photographed under ultraviolet illumination. 2.4.1.8 Purification of DNA fragments from agarose gels DNA fragments were purified from TAE agarose gels for subsequent manipulation, using either the GeneClean II kit (BIO 101 Inc.) or the Wizard PCR prep kit (Promega). In the first procedure, the desired fragment was excised from the gel using a clean razor blade and dissolved in 1 ml of 6 M sodium iodide solution for five minutes at 50 °C. 5 \\(\\mu\\)l of Glassmilk (a DNA binding silica matrix) was added and the mixture was incubated on ice for 15 minutes. The Glassmilk was pelleted by a brief centrifugation, then washed three times in 1 ml of NEW Wash (an ethanol-based buffered salt solution) and pelleted again. The pellet was air-dried for 10 minutes, then the DNA was eluted in 10-20 \\(\\mu\\)l of TE buffer, by incubating at 50 °C for 2-3 minutes, pelleting the resin by centrifugation and retaining the supernatant. Using the Promega Wizard PCR prep kit, the gel slice was dissolved in 1 ml of DNA binding resin by incubation at 50 °C for five minutes. The resin was absorbed onto a minicolumn and washed with 2 ml of 80 % v/v isopropanol. Finally, DNA was eluted with 40-50 \\(\\mu\\)l of prewarmed TE buffer (70 °C) by a brief centrifugation. The yield of purified DNA fragment was analysed by agarose gel electrophoresis in TBE buffer. 2.4.1.9 Transformation of competent E. coli with plasmid DNA E. coli strains were transformed with plasmid DNA by two methods: chemical transformation using CaCl\\(_2\\)242 and electroporation. For chemical transformations, an overnight culture of E. coli was reinoculated in 50 ml of LB medium at a dilution of 1/100 and grown to an absorbance at 650 nm of 0.3-0.5. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 10 ml of 0.1 M MgCl\\(_2\\) and incubated on ice for 15 minutes. Cells were then harvested once more, resuspended in 1 ml of 0.1 M CaCl\\(_2\\) and incubated on ice for one hour. At this stage, the competent cells could be stored at -70 °C in 25% v/v glycerol for several months. To transform the cells, a 100 \\(\\mu\\)l aliquot was mixed with 10 \\(\\mu\\)l of a ligation reaction, or 1-2 \\(\\mu\\)l of a plasmid purified by the alkaline lysis miniprep protocol, and incubated on ice for a further 45 minutes. The cells were then heat-shocked at 42 °C for 30 seconds in thin-walled polypropylene tubes, placed on ice and mixed with 1 ml of LB medium. Cells were left to recover for 90-120 minutes, with shaking at 37 °C, before plating out on a medium selective for the presence of the plasmid. For electroporation, E. coli was grown to an A\\(_{650}\\) of 0.5-1.0 and harvested by centrifugation. The pellet was then repeatedly resuspended and harvested in decreasing volumes of ice-cold sterile water in the following order: 1 volume, 0.5 volumes, 0.5 volumes and 0.02 volumes. After the final wash the cells were harvested once more and resuspended in 0.02 volumes of sterile 10% v/v ice-cold glycerol. 40 \\(\\mu\\)l aliquots of cells were mixed with 1 \\(\\mu\\)l of ligation mix (diluted 1:4 in sterile water) in a 1 ml electroporation cuvette (BioRad). The cells were given a pulse of 2500 V in a BioRad E. coli Pulser, mixed with 1 ml of LB and left to recover at 37 °C for one hour. Several dilutions were plated out on medium selective for the presence of the plasmid. 2.4.1.10 Transformation of Gram-negative bacteria by mating with E. coli S17-1 E. coli S17-1 has the tra genes of the RP4 plasmid integrated into its chromosome, allowing the transfer of plasmids that contain an origin of transfer (Mob site) to a recipient Gram-negative bacterium via a sex pilus.228 Donor E. coli cells containing the plasmid and the recipient strain were both grown to an A\\(_{650}\\) of 0.5-1.0. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with LB medium and harvested in 0.3 ml of LB. Harvested cells were then mixed, pipetted onto a sterile nitrocellulose filter on an LB plate and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The mated cells were harvested from the filter in 0.8 ml of LB. Serial dilutions of the mating mix were then plated onto medium which was selective for both the plasmid and the recipient strain and incubated at 37 °C until single colonies appeared. These were isolated and further analysed to confirm the presence of the plasmid and that the colonies were of the recipient bacterium. 2.4.1.11 Preparation of chromosomal DNA Chromosomal DNA from T. pantotropha was isolated by two methods, depending on the yield required. For large-scale isolation, 200 ml cultures were grown aerobically overnight on LB medium. The culture was divided into 50 ml portions and harvested by centrifugation. Each pellet was washed in 2.5 ml STE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA) and resuspended in 15 ml STE buffer. SDS was added to a concentration of 0.15% w/w and the lysate was incubated at 37 °C for 90-180 minutes with 5 units each of proteases PS147 and P4880 (Sigma). The mixture was extracted with 20 ml of phenol:chloroform by gentle mixing for 10 minutes and centrifuged at 4000 g for 45 minutes. The aqueous phases were re-extracted twice with chloroform and pooled in a sterile 250 ml beaker. DNA was precipitated overnight at -20 °C with 10 ml of 3 M sodium acetate pH 5.2 and 100 ml ethanol. The DNA was then spooled onto a glass rod and left to dissolve in 2 ml of TE buffer at 4 °C for 2-3 days. DNA concentration and purity were determined by the absorbance ratio A\\(_{260}\\):A\\(_{280}\\) and restriction of the DNA analysed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Smaller scale purification was performed using the Promega Wizard genomic DNA purification kit, largely according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Using this procedure, 1 ml of overnight culture was lysed and treated with RNase, after which protein was precipitated and removed by centrifugation. Chromosomal DNA was then precipitated by isopropanol, washed with 70% v/v ethanol, and dissolved in TE buffer overnight at 4 °C. 2.4.1.12 Polymerase chain reaction methods The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was routinely used to generate DNA fragments for cloning and sequencing. Many variations of the technique were used; however, a typical reaction (50 \\(\\mu\\)l) contained 10-500 ng of template genomic DNA, PCR buffer (10 mM Tris HCl pH 9.0, 50 mM KCl, 0.1% Triton X-100), 1.5 mM MgCl\\(_2\\), 0.2 mM each dNTP, 25 pmol of forward and reverse primers and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase. Amplification was performed in 0.5 ml thin-walled Eppendorf tubes, in a programmable thermocycler (MJ Research Inc.). A typical cycle would consist of denaturation (97 °C, 3 minutes), followed by 30 cycles of denaturation (94 °C, 1 minute), primer annealing (55 °C, 2 minutes) and extension (72 °C, 2 minutes), with a final extension step of 72 °C for 10 minutes. PCR products were analysed by electrophoresis on agarose gels in TBE buffer. Taq polymerase catalyses the addition of a single dNTP residue (normally dATP, Clark 1988)243 to the 3’ end of PCR products, which allows them to be cloned into linearised vectors with a 5’ dTTP overhang. The pGEM-T cloning kit (Promega) was used for this purpose. Typically, 5 \\(\\mu\\)l of a PCR product purified by the GeneClean method was ligated to 1 \\(\\mu\\)l of PGEM-T vector in a 10 \\(\\mu\\)l reaction, as described previously. The ligation mix was used to transform competent cells as described in Section 2.5.19. 2.4.1.13 Southern blotting of DNA using the digoxigenin detection system Probes for Southern blotting were generated by random priming of DNA fragments using hexanucleotides, Klenow DNA polymerase and a deoxynucleotide triphosphate mixture containing dUTP coupled to digoxigenin (DIG-11-UTP). The latter was detected on a membrane using antibodies to digoxigenin, which were coupled to alkaline phosphatase. To generate the probe, approximately 1 \\(\\mu\\)g of DNA template (a restriction fragment or PCR product homologous to the region to be probed) was denatured by boiling and chilled in an ice-brine mixture. 10 \\(\\mu\\)l of denatured DNA was mixed with 2 \\(\\mu\\)l of DIG labelling mix (1 mM DATP, SCTP and DGTP, 6.5 mM UTP, 0.35 mM HTTP, 0.35 mM DIG-11-UTP), 2 \\(\\mu\\)l random hexanucleotides (62.5 A\\(_{260}\\) units ml\\(^{-1}\\)) and 5 units of Klenow fragment in a total volume of 20 \\(\\mu\\)l and incubated at 30 °C overnight. Probe DNA was precipitated with 0.1 volumes of 4 M LiCl and 2.5 volumes of ethanol, washed with ice-cold 70% v/v ethanol, air dried and redissolved in 20 \\(\\mu\\)l of TE buffer. The DNA to be probed was separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and transferred overnight at room temperature to a positive nylon membrane by capillary transfer with 0.4 M NaOH. The membrane was then prehybridised at 68 °C for one hour in 20 ml of hybridisation buffer (5x SSC, 1% w/v blocking reagent, 0.1% w/v N-laurylsarcosine, 0.02% w/v SDS). Approximately 0.5 \\(\\mu\\)g of probe DNA was heat-denatured, chilled and added to 5 ml of prehybridisation buffer. The membrane was hybridised at 68 °C overnight. For washing and probe detection, the membrane was washed twice in 50 ml 2x SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature for five minutes, then twice in 50 ml 0.1x SSC, 0.1% SDS at 68 °C for 15 minutes. The membrane was equilibrated for one minute in TS buffer (100 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl), then blocked for 30 minutes in TSB buffer (TS buffer plus 1% w/v blocking reagent). Anti-DIG-alkaline phosphatase antibody conjugate was diluted 1:5000 in TSB buffer and the membrane was incubated in this solution for 30 minutes. The membrane was washed twice for 15 minutes with TS buffer and equilibrated for two minutes in substrate buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl pH 9.5, 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM MgCl\\(_2\\)). The bound probe was detected colorimetrically by incubating the membrane in the dark without shaking in 20 ml of substrate buffer containing 400 \\(\\mu\\)M nitroblue tetrazolium and 400 \\(\\mu\\)M 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. Colour development was stopped by washing the membrane in TE buffer. 2.4.1.14 DNA sequencing methods Plasmid DNA was sequenced by the dideoxy-chain termination method,244 using the Sequenase 2.0 kit (Amersham). Sequencing was divided into three stages: template denaturation plus primer annealing, labelling and termination. 1 \\(\\mu\\)g of plasmid DNA was denatured either by boiling for five minutes then chilling on ice, or by incubation in 0.2 M NaOH for 5 minutes at 37 °C. In the latter case, the NaOH was neutralised with 0.2 M HCl after denaturation. Approximately 1 pmol of sequencing primer was annealed to the template at 37 °C for 10 minutes, in a volume of 10 \\(\\mu\\)l. The DNA labelling reaction comprised the 10 \\(\\mu\\)l solution of annealed DNA template plus primer, which was made up to a final volume of 16 \\(\\mu\\)l containing the following components: \\(^{35}\\)S-dATP (6.25 \\(\\mu\\)Ci), DTT (3.2 mM), Sequenase reaction buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 20 mM MgCl\\(_2\\)), 0.25 \\(\\mu\\)M each of dCTP, dGTP and dTTP, and 1.6 units of Sequenase enzyme. In some reactions two optional additions were made: (1) 3.2 mM MnCl\\(_2\\) plus 5 mM sodium isocitrate, which permitted reading of the sequence closer to the primer, and/or (2) 7% v/v DMSO, which alleviated the problem of secondary structure formation during extension of the labelled DNA fragments. The labelling reaction was incubated at room temperature for five minutes. Following labelling, the reaction mix was divided into four aliquots and each of these was mixed with 2.5 \\(\\mu\\)l of termination mixture (which contained 80 \\(\\mu\\)M of each dNTP plus 8 \\(\\mu\\)M of the appropriate dideoxy-NTP, in 50 mM NaCl). The termination reactions were performed at 42 °C for five minutes. In some reactions DMSO was added to a concentration of 7% v/v, to eliminate the formation of secondary structure as described above. Finally, each reaction was inactivated with the addition of 4 \\(\\mu\\)l of stop solution (95% v/v formamide, 20 mM Na\\(_2\\)EDTA, 0.05% w/v each of bromophenol blue and xylene cyanol FF). 3.5 \\(\\mu\\)l of the A, C, G and T termination reactions were electrophoresed side by side on a 6% acrylamide sequencing gel, in TBE buffer at a constant power of 70 W. Following separation the gel was dried under vacuum at 80 °C and exposed to X-ray film. PCR products were sometimes sequenced directly from low melting point agarose gels.245 Following electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels (NuSieve GTG), a gel slice containing the PCR product was melted at 68 °C. The DNA was denatured by boiling, chilled on ice and annealed to approximately 1 pmol of primer in a volume of 10 \\(\\mu\\)l as described for plasmid DNA. Subsequent sequencing reactions were carried out as described above, except that labelling was at 37 °C, to prevent solidification of the agarose. 2.4.1.15 Computer analysis of DNA data Most DNA data analysis was performed using the GCG8-Open VMS and UNIX software suite,246 Genetics Computer Group, Wisconsin, USA, maintained at the William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford. Freely-available software on the World Wide Web was also used widely and is referred to in the relevant chapters. 2.4.1.16 Oligonucleotide synthesis and preparation Oligonucleotides for sequencing, PCR and primer extension were synthesised by Val Cooper at the Oligonucleotide Synthesis Service, Dyson Perrins Organic Chemistry Laboratory, University of Oxford. Before use, oligonucleotides were incubated at 55 °C overnight to evaporate residual ammonia. They were then recovered by ethanol precipitation and redissolved in sterile distilled water. 2.4.2 RNA manipulation 2.4.2.1 Extraction of total RNA from Thiosphaera pantotropha No single published protocol was used to isolate total RNA from cells of Thiosphaera pantotropha; the protocol described below was based on the methods described by Chattopadhyay et al. (1993)247 and Majumdar et al. (1991).248 50 ml cultures were grown to mid-exponential phase, harvested by centrifugation and lysed in 4 ml of lysis buffer (1% SDS, 1 mM EDTA pH 8.0). The lysate was extracted with 4 ml of phenol:chloroform, saturated with 2 M sodium acetate pH 4.0 and centrifuged at 4000 g for 10 minutes, 4 °C. The aqueous phase was then re-extracted with 4 ml of chloroform and recovered by centrifugation. 0.8 volumes of isopropanol was added and the mixture was incubated on ice for 30 minutes, then centrifuged at 15 000 g for 15 minutes at 4 °C. The precipitated nucleic acids were redissolved in 200 \\(\\mu\\)l of DNase buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 10 mM NaCl, 6 mM CaCl\\(_2\\)), containing 100 units of RNase-free DNase and incubated at 37 °C for 30 minutes. After DNase treatment, the mixture was extracted once more with an equal volume of phenol:chloroform and the RNA was ethanol-precipitated by incubating at -70 °C, followed by centrifugation at 15 000 g for 15 minutes, 4 °C. The pellet was washed with 100 \\(\\mu\\)l of ice-cold 70 % v/v ethanol, air-dried and redissolved in 100 \\(\\mu\\)l of RNase-free water. RNA quality was analysed by the absorbance ratio A\\(_{260}\\):A\\(_{280}\\) and by denaturing gel electrophoresis (Section 2.5.32). 2.4.2.2 Formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis Denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis in the presence of formamide was used to examine the integrity of RNA preparations and to separate RNA molecules by size before transfer to a membrane for Northern blotting. Up to 20 \\(\\mu\\)g of total RNA in 4.5 \\(\\mu\\)l was made up to a volume of 20 \\(\\mu\\)l, in MOPS buffer (20 mM morpholinopropanesulphonic acid pH 7.0, 5 mM sodium acetate, 0.5 mM EDTA) containing 50% v/v freshly deionised formamide and 2.2 M formaldehyde. The RNA was denatured by heating at 80 °C for 3 minutes, then placed on ice. 1% formaldehyde-agarose gels were prepared by dissolving 1 g of agarose in a 50 ml solution containing MOPS buffer and 2.2 M formaldehyde. 4 \\(\\mu\\)l of loading dye (50% v/v glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, 0.4 % w/v bromophenol blue, 33 ng \\(\\mu\\)l\\(^{-1}\\) ethidium bromide) was added to the RNA samples before loading and the gel was run at a constant voltage of 100 V for 5-6 hours. Gels were examined and photographed under ultraviolet light. 2.4.2.3 Northern blotting Northern blotting was used to detect specific mRNA transcripts from denitrification genes in T. pantotropha. The method used closely followed that of Engler-Blum et al. (1993).249 Following formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis, the gel was washed with 20x SSC for 20 minutes. RNA was then transferred to a positive nylon membrane (Boehringer Mannheim) by capillary transfer with 20x SSC at 4 °C and crosslinked to the membrane using UV illumination. A lane containing molecular size markers was cut from the membrane and stained with methylene blue (0.2% w/v in 0.2 M sodium acetate pH 4.7). The membrane was prehybridised for one hour at 68 °C in a high SDS phosphate buffer (250 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.2, 1 mM EDTA, 20% w/v SDS). A DIG labelled dsDNA probe (Section 2.5.22) was hybridised to the RNA in 10 ml of the same buffer at 68 °C overnight. The membrane was washed three times for 20 minutes each at 65 °C in 50 ml of H-wash buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.2, 1% w/v SDS, 1 mM EDTA), then once for five minutes in W-wash buffer (100 mM maleic acid pH 8.0, 3 M NaCl, 0.3% v/v Tween-20) and blocked for one hour in blocking buffer (W-wash buffer plus 0.5% w/v blocking reagent, Boehringer Mannheim). DIG antibody-alkaline phosphatase conjugate was diluted 1:10 000 in blocking buffer and the membrane was incubated with 20 ml of this buffer for 30 minutes. The membrane was then washed four times for 10 minutes each with W-wash buffer and equilibrated for five minutes in substrate buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl pH 9.5, 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM MgCl\\(_2\\)). The hybridised probe was detected either colorimetrically or by chemiluminescence. For colorimetric detection, the membrane was incubated with 20 ml of colour solution (Section 2.5.22) in the dark without shaking until bands appeared. Development was stopped by washing with TE buffer. For chemiluminescent detection, the alkaline phosphatase substrate CSPD (Boehringer Mannheim) was diluted 1:100 in 1 ml of substrate buffer and pipetted onto the membrane. Following a five minute incubation in the dark, excess solution was removed and the membrane was incubated in a sealed hybridisation bag at 37 °C for 15 minutes. The membrane was then exposed to X-ray film (Kodak), initially for one hour, until exposed bands appeared on the film. 2.4.2.4 Primer extension analysis Primer extension was used to determine the 5’-end of the nirS gene mRNA transcript. The procedure was divided into 3 stages: oligonucleotide labelling, primer-RNA annealing and cDNA extension. 10 pmol of oligonucleotide was end-labelled in a 20 \\(\\mu\\)l reaction containing kinase buffer (70 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 10 mM MgCl\\(_2\\), 5 mM DTT), 50 \\(\\mu\\)Ci of \\(\\gamma^{32}\\)P-ATP and 8 units of polynucleotide kinase, exactly as described in Sambrook (1989). The labelled oligonucleotide was redissolved in 100 \\(\\mu\\)l of TE buffer and could be stored at -20 °C for up to 1 week. 1 \\(\\mu\\)l (approximately 109 cpm) of labelled primer was annealed to 40 \\(\\mu\\)g of heat denatured RNA in 20 \\(\\mu\\)l of annealing buffer (2 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.9, 250 mM KCl, 0.2 mM EDTA) at 50 °C for 90 minutes. The annealed primer-RNA was then ethanol-precipitated, redissolved in 20 \\(\\mu\\)l of reverse transcription mix (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.3, 75 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl\\(_2\\), 10 mM DTT, 1.3 mM each dNTP, 20 units RNasin inhibitor, 50 \\(\\mu\\)g ml\\(^{-1}\\) actinomycin D, 33 units AMV reverse transcriptase) and incubated at 37 °C for 2 hours. DNA synthesis was stopped with 25 mM EDTA, pH 8.0. The mixture was treated with RNase at 37 °C for 20 minutes, extracted with phenol-chloroform, ethanol-precipitated and redissolved in 4 \\(\\mu\\)l of TE buffer. 6 \\(\\mu\\)l of sequencing stop solution was added and the labelled cDNA was run on a 6% acrylamide sequencing gel alongside a reference sequencing ladder generated using the same primer. 2.4.2.5 5’-RACE (Rapid amplification of cDNA 5’ ends) 5’-RACE was used as an alternative method to determine the 5’-end of mRNA transcripts. The procedure used closely followed that of Frohman (1993).250 10 \\(\\mu\\)g of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using the nirS sequence specific primer 284R (5’-GACATCCTGCTGCGCAAGGT-3’). The mixture was then diluted with TE buffer, excess primer and nucleotides were removed by centrifugation through a Centricon-100 filter and the cDNA was recovered on a Millipore spin filter in 10 \\(\\mu\\)l of TE buffer. Addition of the poly-dATP tail and the two subsequent nested PCR amplifications were performed exactly as described by Frohman (1993), using the forward primers Q\\(_T\\), Q\\(_0\\) and Q\\(_1\\) (detailed in Frohman, 1993) and the sequence specific reverse primers 242R (5’-ATAGTCGGTGCGCGTCTT-3’) and 228R (5P-TCTTGTGGTCCTCCAGCG-3’). PCR products were analysed by electrophoresis on 1.2% agarose gels, cloned into the pGEM-T vector and sequenced using M13 universal primers.

These are from the organisms Ps. aeruginosa NTCC 6750,134 Ps. stutzeri JM300,139 Ps. stutzeri Zobell,138 P. denitrificans PD1222,141 P. denitrificans IFO 12442140 and A. eutrophus H16.142 Additionally, small lengths of peptide sequence have been determined from several cytochromes cd\\(_1\\) as a result of either N-terminal or internal protein sequencing, e.g. from Pseudomonas stutzeri JM300251 and Thiobacillus denitrificans.252 The initial aim of the present work, the sequencing of the structural gene for cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) (nirS) from T. pantotropha, was important for several reasons. First, the published crystal structure of the enzyme was determined from the electron density map using comparison to the sequence of the protein from P. denitrificans PD1222.127 Although this procedure fitted the diffraction data well, the authentic protein sequence was required to resolve any ambiguities, for instance in the N-terminus of the protein which was disordered in the crystal structure, and to refine the structure. Second, knowledge of the nirS nucleotide sequence was essential for future work involving manipulation of the gene; for example restriction mapping, cloning procedures and mutagenesis. Mapping of the regions either side of the nirS gene would also facilitate cloning and allow comparison of the nir region in T. pantotropha to the closely-related P. denitrificans PD1222. Third, knowledge of the cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) peptide sequence allows comparison with other cytochromes cd\\(_1\\) and analysis of the similarities and differences within this group of enzymes. This chapter describes the strategy used to sequence the nirS gene from T. pantotropha. The DNA sequence is reported and analysed, including comparison with the sequences from two strains of P. denitrificans. The translated cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) sequence is reported and compared with other known cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) sequences, using several computer-based methods. This work reveals that there are important differences between the proteins and the comparison with cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) from Ps. stutzeri Zobell is explored in more detail. Finally the relationship between the proposed haem ligands and the mechanism of cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) is discussed, in the light of recent spectroscopic and crystallographic data. 3.2 Sequencing strategy The nirS gene from T. pantotropha was sequenced in collaboration with Dr. Simon Baker, from a series of overlapping PCR products. Initial studies begun before the present project by Dr. Simon Baker had generated a PCR product using degenerate primers that were designed using short lengths of peptide sequence obtained from T. pantotropha cytochrome cd\\(_1\\).238 The sequence of the PCR product indicated that the nirS DNA sequence of T. pantotropha was very similar to that from P. denitrificans PD1222, and so further primers for PCR and sequencing were designed using the sequence of the nirS gene from P. denitrificans PD1222.141 Table 3.1 summarises the primers used. Table 3.1: Primers used to sequence the nirS gene from T. pantotropha.

Figure 3.1 shows the sizes of these four PCR products, the primers used to generate them and their relation to the nirS gene from P. denitrificans PD1222. Figure 3.1: PCR products used to sequence the nirS gene of T. pantotropha. The nir region of P. denitrificans PD1222 is shown, numbered according to the GenBank sequence U05002. Below is a magnified view of the P. denitrificans PD1222 nirS gene, showing its relationship to the four overlapping PCR products AP4, MID1, CU2p2 and NDp1. The lengths of the PCR products and the primer pairs (Table 3.1) used to generate them are shown. Three different clones of each product were used for sequencing, and each clone was sequenced at least twice in both directions. This procedure resolved any ambiguities at each base. Additional sequence information from a genomic clone (plasmid pTNIR3, described in Chapter 4) is completely consistent with the sequence derived from these PCR products. 3.3 Results Altogether, 2008 bp of DNA sequence was obtained, including that from the plasmid pTNIR3 (which contributed 139 bp of upstream sequence, Chapters 4 and 7). This covers the nirS open reading frame (bases 139-1926) and short flanking regions at the 5’ and 3’ ends. The complete DNA sequence is presented in Figure 3.2, with the translated cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) polypeptide sequence aligned below. Also indicated in this figure are features of interest within the non-coding regions of the DNA. Figure 3.2: Sequence of the nirS gene and its product, cytochrome cd\\(_1\\), from T. pantotropha. The ATG start codons of open reading frames are labelled with the gene name and an arrow indicating the direction of transcription. Inverted repeats in the DNA sequence are shown by inward facing pairs of arrows. Putative Shine-Delgarno ribosome binding sites are dash-underlined. The c-haem binding site in cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) is single-underlined. The putative NNR binding site upstream of nirS is boxed. The vertical downward-facing arrow indicates the predicted cleavage site of the periplasmic targeting sequence. 3.3.1 DNA sequence features Three imperfect inverted repeats are prominent in the DNA sequence, at positions 58-79, 1937-1946 and 1951-1968, and one perfect inverted repeat is found at positions 80-89. Similar repeats are found in the sequences from P. denitrificans PD1222141 and P. denitrificans IFO 12442.140 The positions, sequences and previously assigned functions of these repeats are summarised in Table 3.2. Table 3.2: Comparison of inverted repeats in the DNA sequence of the nir region from T. pantotropha with those in the same region of P. denitrificans PD1222.

This appears to correspond to the start of the nirI gene (Section 3.4.1), which in P. denitrificans PD1222 begins Met-Ala-Met-Gly.141 The second ORF at position 2001 begins Met-Ala-Gly; this seems to be the start of the nirE gene (Section 3.4.1), which begins with an identical sequence in P.denitrificans PD1222.141 The nirS genes of T. pantotropha and P. denitrificans PD1222 are 94.1% identical and the GC content of the nirS gene is 64%. 3.3.2 Primary sequence of cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) from T. pantotropha The nirS gene codes for a protein of 596 amino acids, the first 29 of which are predicted to be a cleavable periplasmic targeting sequence (see Discussion, Section 3.4.3 and Figure 3.3). The six previously published cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) sequences were downloaded from the GenBank and Swissprot databases and processed using the program SignalP, which predicts targeting sequences according to the rules developed by von Heijne253 and uses algorithms specifically tested on protein sequences from Gram-negative bacteria.254 The sequences were edited to remove the predicted targeting sequence and aligned using the ClustalW program.189 The multiple sequence alignment was then formatted using the program ALSCRIPT255 to generate Figure 3.4. In this figure, identity between four or more of the sequences is indicated by black shading and similarity is indicated by various grades of grey shading, using amino acid similarity groups based on physicochemical properties. Other shadings are described in the figure legend. Figure 3.3: Predicted cleavage site of the periplasmic targeting sequence in cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) from T. pantotropha. The SignalP program (Nielsen et al., 1997)254 predicts the cleavage site on the basis of three scores, termed C, S and Y. The residue lying immediately after the cleavage site has high C and Y scores and a sharp gradient in the S score. In the above figure it can be seen that the residue Q30 is predicted to be this residue. As described in the text, an N-terminal glutamine as the first residue of the mature protein is fully consistent with experimental data. Figure 3.4: Multiple alignment of cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) sequences. Six previously published cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) sequences (see main text for details) were downloaded from the GenBank and SwissProt databases. The sequence of cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) from T. pantotropha was added to the group. All sequences were edited to remove the predicted periplasmic targeting sequence and aligned using the Program ClustalW.189 The multiple alignment was then processed using the program ALSCRIPT,255 to shade homologous regions and other features of interest. Identity within four or more sequences is indicated by black shading; similarity is indicated by levels of grey shading based on the physicochemical properties of the amino acids. Conserved methionine and histidine residues which could be potential haem ligands are indicated in white on dark-grey and conserved aspartate residues at the end of the third strand in each \\(\\beta\\) propeller (see Appendix A) are shown in white on light-grey.

To generate the unrooted phylogram shown in Figure 3.5a, the multiple alignment was processed using a neighbour-joining method190 to calculate divergence distance between the sequences. The statistical significance of the tree was analysed by the method of bootstrapping191 with 1000 trials and the output was visualised with the program TreeView.192 Figure 3.5b is a phylogenetic tree inferred from 16S ribosomal RNA sequences and used for comparison with the protein sequence tree. Figure 3.5: Phylogenetic tree of cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) sequences compared with a phylogenetic tree of 16S rRNA sequences from the same organisms. (a) The sequences were aligned using the ClustalW program and the tree was calculated using the neighbour-joining method of Saitou and Nei.190 The tree was then analysed using the method of bootstrapping, with 1000 trials and visualised with the program TreeView. Sequence abbreviations are as in Table 3.3. (b) The 16S rRNA tree was calculated in the same way as for the cytochromes cd\\(_1\\), except that gaps were ignored due to the partial nature of the T. pantotropha LMD 92.63 and P. denitrificans PD1222 sequences (obtained from Dr. D.J. Richardson, University of East Anglia). Complete 16S rRNA gene sequences for Ps. stutzeri ATCC 14405, Ps. stutzeri JM300, Ps. aeruginosa DSM 50071 (Psa50071) and P. denitrificans LMG 4218 (Pd4218) were taken from the GenBank database. Complete or partial rRNA sequence is known for four of the organisms under study as indicated in the figure legend; a different strain of Ps. aeruginosa and a third P. denitrificans strain were added to this group for comparison. The incomplete 16S rRNA sequences of P. denitrificans PD1222 and T. pantotropha were obtained from Dr. D.J. Richardson, University of East Anglia (J.P. Carter, S. Spiro and D.J. Richardson, unpublished results). The tree was produced in a similar manner to that for the cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) sequences, except that gaps in the alignment were ignored owing to the partial nature of some of the 16S rRNA sequences. Finally the amino acid composition, molecular weight and predicted isoelectric point of each sequence was analysed using the program ProtParam.256 These data are presented in Table 3.4.

The GC content of the two genes is 64%, a typical figure for genes from Paracoccus species, reflecting the high GC content of the genome (68%).257 In P. denitrificans PD1222, an open reading frame was identified both upstream and downstream of the nirS gene. The upstream ORF was designated nirI and has some sequence homology to the regulatory protein nosR,96,141 in that it is predicted to be an integral membrane protein with a putative iron-sulphur cluster. It is transcribed divergently from the nirS gene. Insertional mutation in nirI results in the loss of cytochrome cd\\(_1\\),141 Chapter 7. The nirI ORF is also present in the sequence from P. denitrificans IFO 12442, although Ohshima et al. (1993)140 failed to identify it as such. Translation of the first 37 codons from the latter sequence shows 97% identity to the P. denitrificans PD1222 NirI protein, with a substitution of Phe for Leu at position 33. In the T. pantotropha sequence, the start of the nirI gene can also be discerned, with a substitution of Arg for Gly at position 4. Downstream of nirs, de Boer et al. (1994)141 identified the gene nirE. The product of this gene shows similarity to a number of S-adenosyl-L-methionine uroporphyrinogen (III) methyltransferases such as the sirohaem biosynthetic gene cysG of E. coli,42 and cobA, a cobalamin biosynthesis gene of S. typhimurium,258 and is thought to be involved in methyl transfer to the isobacteriochlorin ring during the biosynthesis of haem d\\(_1\\). Insertional inactivation of nirE results in the formation of inactive cytochrome cd\\(_1\\), lacking the d\\(_1\\) haem.141 This open reading frame was identified (but not characterised) in P. denitrificans IFO 12442.140 Translation of the first 27 codons from the P. denitrificans IFO 12242 gene shows 81% identity to the P. denitrificans PD1222 NirE product. Once again, the start of the nirE gene can be identified in the T. pantotropha sequence. These sequence data indicate that the structure of the nir gene cluster in the immediate vicinity of nirS is highly conserved in T. pantotropha and the two strains of Paracoccus denitrificans characterised to date. Further mapping of this region, described in Chapter 4, confirms this observation. The non-coding regions flanking the nirS gene contain a number of inverted repeats which are also quite highly conserved. In the T. pantotropha sequence, the first of these (repeat 1, Table 3.1) begins 81 bp upstream of the nirS initiation codon. In P. denitrificans PD1222 this sequence was identified as containing a putative binding site for NNR, a transcriptional activator protein belonging to the FNR family,186 Chapter 7. The NNR gene has been cloned and sequenced in this organism195 and insertional mutagenesis results in the loss of nitrite and nitric oxide reductases. The putative NNR binding sequences are very similar, with a single substitution of T for A at position 12 in the T. pantotropha sequence. This lies in the non-conserved region of the NNR box consensus and is unlikely to be important. An identical sequence to the P. denitrificans PD1222 NNR box is found in the P. denitrificans IFO 12442 sequence, although Ohshima et al. (1993)140 did not identify it as such. Instead, they assigned the TAA trinucleotide as a stop sequence for a putative upstream open reading frame and included part of the NNR box sequence in a larger, downstream repeat. Both of these assignments appear to be erroneous in the light of other data. Expression of cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) in all three organisms is, therefore, concluded to be transcriptionally regulated by the NNR protein. An alignment of these three NNR boxes with the FNR consensus sequence is shown in Figure 3.6. Figure 3.6: Putative NNR binding sites in the upstream regions of the nirS gene aligned with the FNR consensus binding site. The NNR boxes upstream of nirS in T. pantotropha LMD 92.63 (Tp9263), P. denitrificans PD1222 (Pd1222) and P. denitrificans IFO 12442 (Pd12442) are shown as part of a larger inverted repeat, aligned to the consensus FNR binding site derived from anaerobically-regulated E. coli genes.186 Immediately downstream of the NNR box is a small, perfect inverted repeat (repeat 2, Table 3.2). This structure is also seen in the two P. denitrificans sequences but interestingly, in both cases, the first and last dinucleotides are substituted by CC and GG respectively. Hence the repeat structure is preserved, although the sequences differ. No putative function has been assigned to this repeat, but its structural conservation implies that it has some importance. A possible function is the binding of a transcriptional repressor protein; this possibility is explored more fully in Chapter 7. Two more repeat sequences are found between the nirS and nirE genes in T. pantotropha. The first of these (repeat 3, Table 3.2) was identified in the P. denitrificans PD1222 sequence as a perfect 10 bp inverted repeat and is also found in the P. denitrificans IFO 12442 sequence. However, in T. pantotropha the sequence differs at positions five and seven and so is an imperfect repeat. The significance of this repeat is unclear. Finally, a large imperfect repeat (repeat 4, Table 3.2) is found 6 bp downstream of repeat 3 in T. pantotropha. The sequence of this repeat is perfectly conserved in the P. denitrificans PD1222 sequence, but less so in P. denitrificans IFO 12442 where the corresponding sequence differs at positions one and five. In P. denitrificans PD1222 two assignments were made to this sequence; the first GGGGGC hexanucleotide was suggested to be a putative -10 promoter sequence for the nirE gene,141 based on the promoter consensus for purple non-sulphur bacteria of Steinrücke and Ludwig (1993),257 whilst the structure as a whole was suggested by the same authors to be a putative oxygen responsive element (ORE). An ORE is a region of dyad symmetry found upstream of genes that are regulated by oxygen; it was first identified in photosynthetic genes from the genus Rhodobacter259 and is thought to bind a protein that represses transcription under aerobic conditions. Steinrücke and Ludwig (1993)257 have proposed that some Paracoccus are also ORE-regulated. Both of the assignments proposed by de Boer et al. (1994)141 were tentative and both now appear unlikely. Based on the finding that nirS is transcribed as a single mRNA species (see Chapter 7 for data and discussion), this feature could be involved in transcriptional termination. 3.4.2 Analysis of the seven primary sequences of cytochromes cd\\(_1\\) A ClustalW multiple alignment of the six previously published cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) sequences plus the T. pantotropha sequence is shown in Figure 3.4. It is clear that as a group, the cytochromes cd\\(_1\\) are extremely highly conserved. In this alignment identity between four or more sequences is indicated by black shading. A large number of identical regions are apparent, particularly around the c-haem binding region and in the haem d\\(_1\\) binding domain (which corresponds to residues 135-567 in the mature T. pantotropha sequence). The T. pantotropha enzyme shows most homology to the two P. denitrificans sequences (97.1% identity to P. denitrificans PD1222); of all the pairwise comparisons, the lowest identity is still considerable (52.7% between Ps. stutzeri JM300 and P. denitrificans IFO 12442). However, variation is apparent within the N-terminal region, a point which is returned to presently. The ClustalW alignment was used as the basis for construction of a phylogenetic tree. To generate this tree, the ClustalW program uses the neighbour-joining method of Saitou and Nei.190 Briefly, this algorithm compares all pairs of sequences in an alignment and computes a percentage divergence between them. A correction is included to take account of the possibility that multiple mutations can occur at one site. Pairs of sequences are then joined and connected to the other sequences by an internal branch, such that the total branch length is minimised. The joined sequences are merged and the process is repeated, so an alignment of N sequences allows an unrooted tree with N-3 internal branches. To place confidence limits on the tree, the method of bootstrapping191 was employed. This process is quite complex, but essentially for an alignment of N residues in length, a random sample of N sites is taken, from which a distance matrix and tree can be calculated. This process is repeated a large number of times (1000 is a typical figure) and a site may be selected several times, or not at all, in any given sample. If the sample trees are similar to one another and the tree from the complete data set, the tree is strongly supported. A particular grouping of sequences is considered significant at the 95% confidence level if it occurs in 95% or more of the bootstrap samples. The biological significance of the tree, in terms of phylogenetic relationships will always be a rather subjective judgement, based on factors such as agreement between trees from different data sources (e.g. protein and rRNA sequences) and other taxonomic schemes for grouping organisms. Figure 3.5a shows that the T. pantotropha sequence lies closest to that from P. denitrificans PD1222 and that these two form a group with P. denitrificans IFO 12442. This group is most distant from the two strains of Ps. stutzeri which group together. The proteins from Ps. aeruginosa and A. eutrophus are approximately equidistant from these two groups and closer to each other than the other enzymes. This grouping is what would be expected from the current consensus opinion of the phylogeny of the Proteobacteria.260 For comparison, a phylogenetic tree constructed from 16S ribosomal RNA sequences is shown in Figure 3.5b. 16S rRNA sequences are widely used to infer phylogeny (the advantages and limitations of the method are discussed in Fox et al. (1992),261 and the results agree closely with that obtained from the cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) sequences. The main results of this analysis can be summarised as follows: (1) comparison of cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) and 16S rRNA sequences between the organisms under consideration gives estimates of relatedness which agree well with one another and with current ideas about bacterial taxonomy and (2) the high similarity of the cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) sequences indicates an interspecies transfer of the nirS gene in the evolutionary past and/or a strong relationship between structure and function in the protein. 3.4.3 Relationship of the primary sequence to the structure of cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) Sequencing of the nirS gene from T. pantotropha has allowed the crystal structure of the enzyme, originally deduced from electron density by comparison with the P. denitrificans PD1222 sequence,127 to be checked for errors and refined.262 There were 14 discrepancies between the density map and the P. denitrificans PD1222 sequence in the original publication of the oxidised crystal structure; the translated protein sequence has confirmed 11 of these (three were shown to be the same as the P. denitrificans sequence), as well as revealing four others that were not apparent earlier (counting from the N-terminus of the mature protein these are K2OR, G101A, E339S and A499T, the corrected amino acid second). The oxidised crystal structure has now been determined at the higher resolution of 1.28 \\(\\unicode{x212b}\\) and is fully consistent with the protein sequence presented in this chapter. The crystal structure of cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) contains 559 residues, giving a calculated molecular weight of 62 249 Da per monomer including the covalently-bound c haem moiety. The monomeric molecular weight as measured by electrospray mass spectrometry was 63 091 +/- 8 Da,101 a discrepancy of 842 Da (when using the P. denitrificans sequence for comparison). From this, it was argued that eight N-terminal residues of the mature protein in the crystal structure were not visible, due to disorder in the crystal packing.127 This has been confirmed by sequencing of the nirS gene. The T. pantotropha nirS gene encodes a protein of 596 amino acids, with a calculated molecular weight of 66 045 Da, including the c haem. The first 29 residues are predicted to be a cleavable periplasmic targeting sequence (Figure 3.3), giving a molecular weight for the mature protein of 63 141 Da. The discrepancy between the latter figure and the molecular weight calculated from the crystal structure is 892 Da, which is accounted for by the first eight residues in the mature T. pantotropha sequence. These residues are QEQVAPPK, an additional molecular weight of 896 Da. The N-terminus of cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) from T. pantotropha is known to be blocked, as it is resistant to Edman degradation.238 An N-terminal glutamine, as postulated above, can account for this by cyclisation to pyroglutamate. The N-terminus of cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) from P. denitrificans IFO 12442 has also been reported to be blocked.140 However, the equivalent eight residue sequence in the two Paracoccus sequences is QEQAAPPK and a further difference (counting from the N-terminus of the uncleaved protein, residue 27 is alanine in the Paracoccus sequences, valine in T. pantotropha) makes the predicted signal cleavage site one residue earlier in both Paracoccus sequences, giving AQEQAAPPK as the mature N-terminus. This would not be expected to show blockage, but in the absence of further experimental data, the predicted mature sequences have been used in this chapter and the effect on the alignment is insignificant. The crystal structure of cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) from T. pantotropha showed that the c haem was ligated by His-17 and His-69 (numbering is with the targeting sequence removed) and the d\\(_1\\) haem by Tyr-25 and His-200.127 Both of these arrangements were somewhat unexpected; first, bis-histidyl ligation is normally associated with low-potential haems,150,263 whereas the c-haem in cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) has a midpoint redox potential of around 243 mV (A. Koppenhöfer, unpublished data). Second, tyrosyl ligation to haem groups, which is most common in bacterial catalases264 also results in a low redox potential, as illustrated by mutant forms of haemoglobin265 and myoglobin.266 The midpoint redox potential of the d\\(_1\\) haem in cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) from T. pantotropha is not known but is likely to be a few tens of millivolts lower than that of the c haem (Chapter 1, Table 1.2). However, the protein sequence confirms the presence of all of these residues. His-17 and Tyr-25 are located towards the N-terminus of the protein, which Figure 3.4 shows to be the least conserved region of the cytochromes cd\\(_1\\). Intriguingly, inspection of Figure 3.4 shows that these residues are conserved only in T. pantotropha and the two strains of Paracoccus. The other proteins lack the N-terminal extension seen in these sequences which contains the two haem ligands. Of the other proteins, only that from Ps. aeruginosa contains a histidine or tyrosine residue at even roughly similar positions in the N-terminus before the c haem binding site. This finding was extremely unexpected. Ligands to the haem groups control several important factors such as the redox potential, substrate accessibility and the reaction mechanism; in T. pantotropha, Tyr-25 has been postulated to play a crucial role in the release of nitric oxide from the haem group.127 The importance of these residues and the overall high similarity of the proteins suggests that functional amino acids should be highly conserved. For this reason, it was decided to re-sequence the relevant segment of the nirS sequence from Ps. stutzeri Zobell so as to examine the possibility that the sequence had been mis-reported, or that errors in the sequence (such as base changes or frame shifts) could have resulted in the apparent absence of at least Tyr 25. Two sets of forward and reverse primers, flanking the N-terminal region of the nirS protein, were designed and used to amplify genomic DNA from Ps. stutzeri Zobell, as shown in Figure 3.7. Figure 3.7: Early region of the nirS gene from Ps. stutzeri ATCC 14405, showing primers used for re-sequencing and the sequence obtained. The downward arrow indicates a deletion of about 40 amino acids seen when the cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) sequence is aligned to that of T. pantotropha. Primers designed to flank this region (FOR1, FOR2, REV1 and REV2) are indicated by horizontal arrows. The sequence obtained is annotated as follows; dotted underline = sequenced once in one direction, single underline = sequenced twice in forward direction, double underline = sequenced in both directions. The four resulting PCR products were directly sequenced from low-melting point agarose using these primers. Figure 3.7 indicates the region, direction and strand coverage (forward, reverse or both) of the sequence obtained. This sequence was 100% identical to that deposited in the GenBank database. It is thus clear that the gene sequence is correct and that the tyrosyl and histidyl ligands in the protein from T. pantotropha really are absent from at least the Ps. stutzeri Zobell enzyme. This result raises a number of possibilities. First, the c- and d\\(_1\\) haems in cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) in the oxidised state from Ps. stutzeri (and from other species) may be liganded by tyrosyl and histidyl residues lying elsewhere in the polypeptide chain. This would result in a substantially different tertiary structure in these enzymes and given the overall high sequence homology, does not seem to be a credible proposal. Second, the other cytochromes cd\\(_1\\) may have different haem ligands (such as the conserved methionines and histidines seen in Figure 3.4), which could preserve a similar structure to the T. pantotropha protein, but might be expected to result in different spectroscopic and biochemical properties. Third, the oxidised T. pantotropha enzyme structure may not be representative of the physiologically-active structure found in vivo; the latter, hypothetical, structure may have the haem ligands that are conserved between all cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) sequences. In order to examine the optical spectrum of cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) from Ps. stutzeri Zobell more closely, it was purified using the same procedure as that for the T. pantotropha protein. This protocol gave a product that was approximately 90-95% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE. The spectra of the oxidised and reduced forms of the enzyme are shown in Figure 3.8. Figure 3.8: Visible spectra of cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) (a) in the oxidised and (b) in the reduced forms from Ps. stutzeri Zobell. As isolated, cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) from Ps. stutzeri Zobell exhibited absorbance maxima at 416, 526, 554 and 645 nm. Following reduction with dithionite maxima were observed at 421 (not shown), 464, 526, 553, 557 and 660 nm. The reversal in the relative amplitudes of the peaks at 548 and 554 nm referred to in the text is clearly visible in (b). Overall, the spectra of the seven cytochromes cd\\(_1\\) that have been sequenced are very similar. In the oxidised form there are peaks at or near 411 and 640 nm, with shoulders around 561, 325 and 360 nm. In the reduced form, peaks at 418, 460, 521, 548, 554 and 625 nm (dithionite-reduced) or 655 nm (ascorbate-reduced) are seen. The absorbances at 655/625 and 460 nm are assigned to the d\\(_1\\) haem, whereas the 548-554, 521/525 and 418/411 nm peaks are the \\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\) and \\(\\gamma\\) (Soret) peaks of the c-type haem. However, the enzyme from Ps. stutzeri Zobell shows a small, but interesting difference. In the split \\(\\alpha\\)-peak of the reduced c haem at 548-554 nm, the first peak of the pair is slightly higher for the enzymes from T. pantotropha, P. denitrificans and Ps. aeruginosa. In the purified enzyme from Ps. stutzeri Zobell, this situation is reversed. This feature can be seen in published spectra by other workers73 and was also specifically noted for the enzyme from Ps. stutzeri JM300.251 Interestingly, if the d\\(_1\\) haem is removed from the T. pantotropha protein to give the semi-apo enzyme, the relative heights of the split \\(\\alpha\\)-peaks in the reduced state become reversed, so as to resemble the Ps. stutzeri enzymes (Figure 3.9). Figure 3.9: Visible spectra of (a) holocytochrome cd\\(_1\\) and (b) semi-apo cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) in the reduced forms from T. pantotropha. The reduced holoprotein exhibited absorbance maxima at 418, 460 (not shown), 525, 548, 554 and 650 nm (a). Following removal of the d\\(_1\\) haem the maxima at 460 and 650 nm (not shown) are lost and the amplitude of the peaks at 548 and 554 nm is reversed as compared to the holoprotein, as shown in (b). From the T. pantotropha crystal structure, we know that the Tyr-25 ligand originates in the c haem domain. Hence this result could be interpreted as showing that the d\\(_1\\) haem domain has a subtle effect on the absorption spectrum of the c haem, which is altered when the d\\(_1\\) haem is removed. The apparent lack of this effect in the Ps. stutzeri enzymes might be taken as evidence that a similar link between the c and d\\(_1\\) haem domains does not exist in these proteins. A second interpretation is that d\\(_1\\) haem loss is more extensive during the purification of the Ps. stutzeri enzymes, yielding a species more like the semi-apo enzyme. However, the observation of this spectrum by other groups and previously reported activity measurements251 argue against this idea. In fact, mounting spectroscopic evidence indicates that haem ligation is genuinely not identical in different cytochromes cd\\(_1\\). Magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy of the cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) from Ps. aeruginosa have indicated Met-His ligation at the c haem and His-His ligation at the d\\(_1\\) haem.124 EPR and Mössbauer spectroscopy of the enzyme from Thiobacillus denitrificans suggested His-His ligation at both haems.126 More recently, the T. pantotropha and Ps. stutzeri proteins in the oxidised form have been compared using EPR and MCD spectroscopy at the University of East Anglia.125 The latter method in particular is regarded as the most accurate diagnostic of haem ligation.267 The EPR and MCD data are interpreted as being consistent with His-His ligation at the c haem in the T. pantotropha enzyme although, interestingly, a very small proportion of the sample appears to have Met-His ligation. The d\\(_1\\) haem ligands are more difficult to assign in the absence of data from model compounds, but are thought to be consistent with His-Tyr or possibly His-OH ligation in both cases. However, the c haem in the oxidised Ps. stutzeri enzyme is clearly Met-His ligated, as was previously reported for cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) from Ps. aeruginosa.124 In summary, it is apparent that there are significant differences in haem ligation amongst the cytochromes cd\\(_1\\), though bis-histidyl ligation at the d\\(_1\\) haem and methionyl histidyl ligation at the c haem are commonly assigned to several members of the group. This brings us to the question of whether the T. pantotropha cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) crystal structure is anomalous or in some way misleading. There can be no doubt that the structure is “correct” in terms of the integrity of the diffraction data, its interpretation, the chain tracing methods used and correlation with the protein sequence; the question is whether the structure is physiologically relevant. As described above, MCD spectra of the T. pantotropha enzyme confirm the bis histidyl ligation seen in the oxidised crystal structure, whereas the enzymes from Ps. stutzeri and Ps. aeruginosa are thought to have Met-His ligation to the c haem in the oxidised state. Recent work165 has shown that in reduced crystals of cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) from T. pantotropha (which do not crack when reduced by sodium dithionite, unlike crystals of the Ps. aeruginosa enzyme,147 dramatic changes in haem ligation are observed. Tyr-25 is seen to move away from the d\\(_1\\) haem, as predicted by spectroscopic and mechanistic studies (Chapter 1, Section 1.5.4), but at the c haem His-17 is no longer a ligand. Instead, a loop of residues (100-114) moves upwards in the structure and Met-106 becomes a new c haem ligand. This arrangement means that the T. pantotropha enzyme in the reduced state more closely resembles the predicted ligation of the enzymes from Ps. aeruginosa and Ps. stutzeri; additionally Met-106 is a conserved residue in all cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) sequences. These data raise the possibility that the physiologically active form of T. pantotropha cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) is Met-His ligated at the c haem at all times, and that the fully-oxidised His His ligated species is a relaxed or resting artefact which is not returned to in the catalytic cycle. Three alternative reaction schemes are outlined in Figure 3.10. Figure 3.10: Alternative reaction schemes for the reduction of nitrite by cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) starting from the fully oxidised enzyme. (A) The c-haem switches to Met-His ligation on reduction. After intramolecular electron transfer to the d\\(_1\\) haem, the re-oxidised c-haem switches back to His-His ligation. The fully oxidised enzyme is regenerated. (B) The c-haem becomes Met-His ligated on reduction and remains in this state even after reoxidisation. The fully oxidised state is regenerated, but His-His ligation is not. (C) The c-haem becomes His-Met ligated on reduction. After internal electron transfer to the d\\(_1\\) haem, the c-haem is instantly re-reduced by an external electron donor protein and stays in the Met-His ligation state. Neither His-His ligation nor the fully oxidised enzyme are regenerated. Note that all schemes assume Tyr-25 returns to the d\\(_1\\) haem after NO release. Dashed arrows indicate intramolecular electron transfer. M = methionine, H = histidine, Y = tyrosine. In the first, the c haem returns to His-His ligation when it becomes reoxidised following intramolecular electron transfer to the d\\(_1\\) haem. In the second, the c haem remains Met-His ligated after reoxidation and a fully-oxidised His-His species is not regenerated. In the third, a fully oxidised enzyme is not regenerated because re-reduction of the c haem following the first intramolecular electron transfer to the d\\(_1\\) haem is very rapid, preventing the formation of the oxidised His-His ligation state. Further data using reduced crystals of the T. pantotropha enzyme165 has provided some insight into which of these schemes may be correct. It has proved possible to soak the reduced crystals in potassium nitrite and then rapidly freeze them, capturing what are proposed to be structural intermediates in the catalytic cycle. The fully-reduced enzyme molecules in the crystal carry two electrons, which allows two turnovers of the enzyme. The freeze-quenched structures contain molecules captured after the binding of the second nitrite molecule and different structures show either nitrite or nitric oxide bound at the d\\(_1\\) haem. It is clear from the diffraction data that following the reduction of nitrite to nitric oxide at the d\\(_1\\) haem, the c haem has returned to His-His ligation, as in Figure 3.10a. Such a rearrangement of the haem ligands during catalysis was unexpected and it has been suggested that this is the rate-limiting step of the reaction.165 It is also suggested that the mechanism prevents reduction of the d\\(_1\\) haem whilst NO is still bound; as His-17 and Tyr 25 are on the same stretch of the polypeptide chain, return of His-17 to the c haem would facilitate the re-ligation of the d\\(_1\\) haem by Tyr-25, displacing the bound NO. The c haem would then be re-reduced, change to Met-His ligation and transfer its electron to the d\\(_1\\) haem where Tyr-25 would be displaced to begin a new catalytic cycle. However, the data from the experiments of Williams165 are not complete. Crystalline cd\\(_1\\) molecules can undergo only two turnovers whereas in the periplasm it is possible that a constant supply of electrons from donor proteins would act to keep the c haem reduced and in the Met-His state. Notably, stopped flow experiments using the enzyme from Ps. aeruginosa showed that the c haem was more than 90% reduced at all times.161 The conservation of Met-106 in all cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) sequences is also a strong argument for this residue to be more functionally important than His-17 in T. pantotropha cytochrome cd\\(_1\\). The issue will ultimately be resolved by further kinetic studies of cytochrome cd\\(_1\\), in conjunction with site-directed mutagenesis of His-17 and Met-106. The role of the non-conserved Tyr-25 d\\(_1\\) haem ligand remains more problematic. It is clearly a ligand to the c haem in the oxidised crystal structure and can also be seen near the haem, having moved away, in the reduced state. Notably however, it has not yet been observed to return to the d\\(_1\\) haem in the crystal structure after NO release; this step remains hypothetical. Therefore at present it is not possible to say with certainty whether Tyr-25 plays a crucial role in the mechanism of T. pantotropha cytochrome cd\\(_1\\). The lack of sequence conservation in an otherwise highly homologous group of proteins does suggest that Tyr-25 may not be an obligatory residue. Alternatively we have to accept that for some reason, within a set of enzymes that are so strongly conserved as to suggest high structural homology, different functional residues are used for catalysis. The clearest way to resolve this issue, as with the problem of haem ligation in the c domain, will be using site-directed mutagenesis to generate changes at Tyr-25 and analysis of the resultant proteins. As with all site-directed mutagenesis experiments, care will have to be taken to distinguish effects arising due to gross perturbation of the protein tertiary structure from those that involve only alteration around the haem ligation site. Bearing this in mind, obvious candidates for substitution at Tyr-25 are (1) phenylalanine, the same basic structure but lacking the liganding -OH moiety, (2) serine, of small size with an -OH group and (3) histidine, of similar size with the possibility of acting as a ligand, having been tentatively identified in other cytochromes cd\\(_1\\). This work is currently underway in our laboratory and some early data are presented in Chapter 6. Further crystal structures of other cytochromes cd\\(_1\\) will also be of great interest. The purified cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) from Ps. stutzeri Zobell, described in Section 3.4.3, was used for crystallisation trials by Dr. Vilmos Fülöp in the Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics and gave small crystals, though not of diffraction quality. However, we have since learned that the group of Dr. E.N. Baker (Massey University, New Zealand) is close to solving this structure, which should be available in the near future. Very recently the structure of cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) from Ps. aeruginosa has been determined (V. Fülöp, personal communication), although the details have not yet been published. Some aspects of this structure are discussed in Chapter 8.

Although E. coli does not synthesise the d\\(_1\\) haem group, and so cannot express holocytochrome cd\\(_1\\), expression studies in this organism are still valuable for two reasons. First, E. coli provides a convenient experimental system to test gene expression, due to its widespread use in molecular biology, the consequent large technical literature, number of methods and range of plasmids available. This means that experiments using E. coli can be carried out with relative ease and efficiency. Second it is probable that in expression systems that can synthesise the holocytochrome (see Chapters 5 and 6), certain site-directed mutants of the nitrite reductase, the ultimate aim of this work, will be inactive and the host cells will be unable to grow under denitrifying conditions because of the accumulation of toxic nitrite. However, using E. coli (Glockner et al., 1993)63 and Ps. putida (Silvestrini et al., 1992)268 it has already proved possible to express the semi-apo enzyme containing only c haem and then to reconstitute the enzyme with purified d\\(_1\\) haem. The latter approach may be a way of producing sufficient quantities of mutant enzyme for kinetic studies. Previously published data concerning the expression of cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) in E. coli and the expression of other c type cytochromes, both exogenous and endogenous (Iobbi-Nivol et al., 1994)269 indicated that c haem attachment to the T.pantotropha enzyme should not pose a problem. However, a potential problem was that E. coli is quite distantly related to T. pantotropha and so aspects of its genetics such as promoter sequences and codon usage may be quite different. Although seven nirS genes have now been sequenced (including that from T. pantotropha, Chapter 3), expression of cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) from the cloned gene has only been studied in any detail for Ps. aeruginosa, Ps. stutzeri Zobell and P. denitrificans. Three organisms have been used as heterologous hosts for expression. Silvestrini et al. (1992)268 have expressed cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) from Ps. aeruginosa in Ps. putida. In common with E. coli this organism does not make d\\(_1\\) haem and thus the semi-apoprotein, containing c-haem was produced. Glockner et al. (1993)63 have expressed cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) from Ps. stutzeri Zobell in Ps. aureofaciens and E. coli with similar results. Ohshima et al. (1993)140 have expressed the P. denitrificans IFO 12442 nirS gene in E. coli, but in this case it was claimed that active holoprotein was synthesised. Nitric oxide reductase activity was also apparently detectable in this system. An alternative approach to expression of the nirS gene has been described by Zennaro et al. (1993),215 who inactivated the nirS gene in Ps. aeruginosa using a tetracycline cassette and then complemented the mutants with the wild-type gene on a plasmid. This met with some success and is discussed further in Chapter 6. In all cases where semi-apo cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) is produced, it has proved possible to obtain holoprotein by reconstitution with purified haem d\\(_1\\). This has been performed for Ps. aeruginosa (Silvestrini et al., 1992)268 and Ps. stutzeri Zobell (Glockner et al., 1993).63 It is also possible to remove haem d\\(_1\\) chemically from the purified native holoprotein and reconstitute the semi-apo enzyme prepared in this manner to recover most of the activity; this has been described for cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) from Ps. aeruginosa (Hill and Wharton, 1978)118 and Ps. stutzeri M300 (Weeg-Aerssens et al., 1991).251 This chapter describes a series of experiments carried out to express cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) from T. pantotropha in E. coli. First, mapping of the nir gene locus, which was performed to identify a suitable fragment that contained the full-length nirS gene for sub-cloning, is discussed. Cloning of the nirS gene into a broad-host range vector is then described. Expression of the gene in E. coli under aerobic and anaerobic conditions is analysed. The final section describes the partial purification of the expressed semi-apo cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) and a first attempt to reconstitute this material with purified haem d\\(_1\\). Throughout the chapter comparisons with the results of similar experiments from other laboratories are made. 4.2 Results 4.2.1 Sub-cloning of the full-length nirS gene from T. pantotropha The T. pantotropha nirS gene was cloned initially as a set of four overlapping PCR products for sequencing (Chapter 3). For further work, a full length copy of the gene was required. In theory this could be produced by PCR using primers flanking the 5’- and 3’ ends of the gene. PCR reactions using such primers (460F, nirSF, CT3R and nirS2R, Table 3.1, Chapter 3) were performed and appeared to produce fragments of the expected lengths (results not shown). However, extreme difficulty was experienced when attempting to clone the full length products. A large number of remedies were tried, including proteinase K treatment of the PCR products (Hitti and Bertino, 1994),270 the use of TA cloning vectors and different methods of PCR product purification, but none of the putative clones obtained after blue-white selection contained the desired insert when analysed by restriction mapping. In all cases, it appeared that rearrangement of the DNA had occurred. At present, the best explanation for this is that a recurrent error during synthesis of the longer PCR products prevented successful cloning, perhaps because of the expression of a toxic product from the DNA. It therefore became necessary to obtain a genomic clone of the nirS gene. Probing a cosmid library prepared from T. pantotropha genomic DNA by Southern blotting with a nirS gene probe (the MID1 PCR product, Figure 3.1, Chapter 3) failed to identify a positive clone. However, blots of total genomic DNA, digested with PstI, NotI and DdeI, gave single bands in the size range 4.5-6 kbp (results not shown). Attempts to clone these fragments were in progress, when a plasmid containing the T. pantotropha nirS gene was obtained from Thon de Boer, Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam. The plasmid, pTNIR3, contains the nirS gene on a 7.5 kbp SphI fragment cloned in the vector pGEM7zf(+). Plasmid pTNIR3 was analysed by restriction mapping so as to determine the best way of generating a fragment containing the nirS gene for further work. Figure 4.1 shows a restriction map of pTNIR3 obtained using six enzymes. Figure 4.1: Physical map of the plasmid pTNIR3 produced using six restriction enzymes. Plasmid pTNIR3, containing the nirS gene from T. pantotropha, was obtained from Thon de Boer, Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam. It consists of a 7.5 kbp SphI fragment of genomic DNA cloned in pGEM7zf (+). The plasmid was digested with 6 enzymes, both singly and in combination, and the fragments sized by agarose gel electrophoresis to generate the map. Enzyme abbreviations: Sp, SphI; B, BamHI; E, EcoRI; H, HindIII; P, PstI; S, SalI This indicated that the 7.5 kbp insert could be conveniently cut into two fragments of 5.1 kbp and 2.4 kbp using PstI and SphI. These fragments were cloned into the pBS(-) plasmid and the ends of the inserts were sequenced using universal M13 primers. The restriction mapping data in conjunction with the partial DNA sequences were used to align the plasmid pTNIR3 and its derivatives with the sequence of the nir region from P. denitrificans PD1222 (de Boer et al., 1994),141 as shown in Figure 4.2. Figure 4.2: Location of denitrification genes of T. pantotropha on the plasmid pTNIR3 as determined by physical mapping and limited sequencing. Plasmid pTNIR3 was digested with PstI and SphI and the fragments were sub-cloned into pBS(-). The ends of the fragments were then sequenced using M13 universal primers. The plasmids pTNIR3, pB5K and pBNIR are aligned to previously published sequence from P. denitrificans PD1222, covering the nir and nor loci (U05002 and U28078 respectively). No direct evidence was obtained for the presence of the nirJ gene in pTNIR3, although it is assumed to be present by analogy to P. denitrificans PD1222 (de Boer 1996).168 The 5.1 kbp fragment lies upstream of the nirS gene and by analogy to P. denitrificans PD1222 would contain the genes nirI, nirJ, norС and part of the norB gene, in which lies the SphI site. The plasmid containing this fragment is designated pB5K. The 2.4 kbp fragment contains the nirS gene, with the PstI site at the 5’-end of the gene, just upstream of the NNR box, and the SphI site lying in the early region of the downstream nirE gene. This plasmid was designated pBNIR and was selected for further sub-cloning and expression experiments. 4.2.2 Cloning the nirS gene into the broad host range expression vector pMMB67EH The broad host range expression plasmid pMMB67EH (Fürste et al., 1986)271 was chosen as a suitable vector for expression experiments. A diagram of the vector is shown in Figure 4.3. Figure 4.3: Diagram of the broad host range expression vector pMMB67EH, showing relevant features. pMMB67EH (Fürste et al., 1986)271 was used for cloning and expression of the nirS gene from T. pantotropha. Features are described fully in the main text and are as Tollows: bla, \\(\beta\\)-lactamase gene conferring ampicillin resistance, P\\(_{tac}\\), tac promoter, rrnB, terminator derived from the E. coli 5S rRNA gene, oriV, vegetative origin of replication, oriT, origin of transfer, lacI\\(^q\\), over-produced form of the lacI repressor protein. The vector contains an mp18 multiple cloning site and 6 of the restriction enzyme sites that cut in this region are indicated. It contains a number of useful features, which are as follows: (1) A tac promoter, which is a strong hybrid promoter constructed from the trp and lac promoters (de Boer et al., 1983)233 for driving transcription, (2) the mp18 multiple cloning site which is compatible with the pBS(-) plasmid, in two possible orientations (these are designated pMMB67EH and HE), (3) a transcriptional terminator, derived from the rrnB gene, (4) the \\(\\beta\\)-lactamase gene conferring ampicillin resistance, (5) the lacI\\(^q\\) gene, encoding a mutant form of the lacI repressor (Gronenborn, 1976)272 which is overproduced to prevent transcription in the absence of IPTG and (6) an origin of transfer, oriT, allowing transfer of the plasmid to other Gram-negative species by conjugation (Derbyshire and Willetts, 1987).273 This last feature allows the use of the same construct to investigate expression in other bacteria, which is described in Chapters 5 and 6. In theory the 2.4 kbp PstI-SphI fragment derived from the plasmid pBNIR should be easily cloned into the mp18 cloning site of pMMB67EH. However, difficulty was experienced due to the problem of vector carryover as shown in Figure 4.4. Figure 4.4: Restriction digests illustrating the problem of vector carryover during cloning of the T. pantotropha nirS gene into pMMB67EH. A 2.4 kbp PstI-SphI fragment of pBNIR was isolated and used in a ligation reaction with pMMB67EH, also digested with PstI-SphI. E. coli JM83 was then transformed with the ligation mix and ampicillin resistant clones screened for the presence of the desired plasmid by restriction digests using PstI plus SphI and electrophoresis on a 0.8% agarose gel. However, in this case, all the plasmids recovered are either the original pBNIR plasmid (lanes 3, 6 and 7) or the pMMB67EH plasmid (lanes 1, 2, 4, 5 and 8) that has re-ligated due to incomplete digestion. Solutions to the problem are described in the text. The gel is displayed as a negative image to show faint bands more clearly. Lanes labelled III and II contain DNA size standards, the sizes of some of which are indicated at the left of the gel. This problem occurs when a fragment of similar size to the vector fragment is isolated from an agarose gel. A small amount of vector can be carried over with the desired fragment and, as pBS(-) is smaller than pMMB67EH, religation of the original plasmid occurs with higher efficiency producing clones containing the original vector. This is a particular problem when the two vectors contain the same antibiotic resistance determinant (in this case ampicillin). To circumvent this problem, a kanamycin resistance cassette was inserted in the PstI site of pBNIR to give the plasmid pBNIRK. The cassette and nirS gene were then isolated together as an XbaI-SphI fragment and cloned into pMMB67EH. This step introduces a new antibiotic resistance determinant and also increases the size of the insert by 1.2 kbp, thus improving its separation from the vector fragment. Several positive clones were selected by kanamycin resistance. The isolated plasmid, pMMBSEK, was then cut with PstI and subjected to partial religation to remove the kanamycin cassette. Cells of E. coli JM83 were re-transformed and ampicillin resistant clones were streaked onto plates containing either ampicillin or ampicillin plus kanamycin. Kanamycin sensitive clones, which had lost the cassette, were re-isolated and the construct was confirmed by restriction digests (Figure 4.5). Figure 4.5: Restriction digest analysis of the plasmids pMMBSE and pMMBSEK. Digests of pMMBSE were performed using SalI (S), BamHI (B), HindIII (H), BglII (Bg), EcoRI (E) and PstI (P) and the fragments were separated by electrophoresis on a 0.8% agarose gel. The fragments shown above are of the expected sizes from the 2.4 kbp fragment of pBNIR, containing the nirS gene, in pMMB67EH. Lane 7 contains a HindIII digest of the plasmid pMMBSEK. This clearly shows an extra fragment of 1.38 kbp from pMMBSEK, which arises due to an extra HindIII site in the centre of the kanamycin cassette. The lane labelled III contains DNA size markers, the sizes of some of which are indicated at the left of the gel. This procedure yielded two plasmids for further work: (1) pMMBSE, containing the nirS gene together with its upstream region (the NNR box and promoter region) and part of the downstream nirE gene, and (2) pMMBSEK, in which the tac promoter and the NNR box are separated by a kanamycin resistance cassette, transcribed in the same direction as the nirS gene. A list of the plasmids referred to in this chapter is given in Table 4.1.

Additionally, cultures of E. coli JM83 [pMMBSEK] and E. coli [pMMBSE] were induced with 1 mM IPTG during the early exponential phase of growth to activate transcription from the tac promoter. Twelve different cultures were grown as outlined in Table 4.2. Table 4.2: Different growth conditions used to compare the growth of E. coli JM83 with that of E. coli containing either pMMB67EH, pMMBSEK or pMMBSE. Wild-type E. coli JM83 and E. coli JM83 [pMMB67EH] were grown either aerobically or anaerobically. E. coli JM83 containing either pMMBSEK or pMMBSE were also grown under these conditions; additionally, these strains could be induced with IPTG during growth under either condition. This gave rise to the 12 different cultures indicated in the table. Culture number Growth conditions Plasmid present IPTG added 1 aerobic no 2 anaerobic no 3 aerobic pMMB67EH no 4 anaerobic pMMB67EH no 5 aerobic pMMBSEK no 6 aerobic pMMBSEK yes 7 anaerobic pMMBSEK no 8 anaerobic pMMBSEK yes 9 aerobic pMMBSE no 10 aerobic pMMBSE yes 11 anaerobic pMMBSE no 12 anaerobic pMMBSE yes 50 ml of each medium was inoculated with a 1:100 dilution of overnight culture that had been grown in 1.5 ml LB medium plus appropriate antibiotics. Aerobic cultures were sampled every 30 minutes and the absorbance at 650 nm was recorded to give the growth curves shown in Figure 4.6. Figure 4.6: Comparison of the aerobic growth of E. coli, E. coli [pMMB67EH], E. coli [pMMBSEK] and E. coli [pMMBSE]. Overnight cultures of wild-type cells and those carrying plasmid were inoculated into LB medium at a dilution of 1/100 and growth was monitored by the increase in absorbance at 650 nm (logarithmic scale). Symbols: (◆) E. coli JM83, (■) E. coli [pMMB67EH], (▲) E. coli [pMMBSEK], (x) E. coli [pMMBSEK] induced with 1 mM IPTG, (□) E. coli [pMMBSE], (●) E. coli [pMMBSE] induced with 1 mM IPTG. Reliable growth curves were not obtained for the anaerobic cultures, because in the cultures containing the nirS gene the cells tended to sediment and adhere quite strongly to the lower wall of the culture tube. The cells could be resuspended by vigorous vortexing, but this was avoided to maintain anaerobic conditions in the tubes. Instead, anaerobic cultures were vortexed once after 12 hours to ascertain that they had entered early exponential phase. At this point, cultures containing E. coli [pMMBSE] and E. coli [pMMBSEK] were induced with 1 mM IPTG and the cultures were left overnight for a total of 24 hours. Comparison with the early growth curve of the anaerobic culture of E. coli [pMMB67EH] indicated that this growth period was sufficient to reach stationary phase without over-growth (Figure 4.7). Figure 4.7: Comparison of the anaerobic growth of E. coli JM83 with that of E. coli [pMMB67EH]. Overnight cultures of wild-type cells and those carrying pMMB67EH were inoculated into E. coli anaerobic medium (Materials and Methods) and growth was monitored by the increase in absorbance at 650 nm (logarithmic scale). As explained in the main text, growth curves for cells containing the other plasmids, pMMBSE and pMMBSEK, could not be obtained. Symbols: (◆) E. coli JM83, (■) E. coli [pMMB67EH]. After 24 hours, the cultures were vortexed to record the final optical density and then harvested. Aerobic cultures were harvested when judged to have just entered stationary phase. Total soluble extracts were prepared from each culture by sonication and ultracentrifugation of the lysate. The protein profile in the extracts from each of the 12 cultures was first investigated using SDS-PAGE and staining for protein using Coomassie Blue (Figure 4.8). Figure 4.8: Comparison of the protein content of E. coli JM83 with that of E. coli [pMMB67EH], E. coli [pMMBSEK] and E. coli [pMMBSE]. 40 \\(\\mu\\)g of total protein per lane was separated by SDS-PAGE on an 8% acrylamide gel and the gel was stained for protein using Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Lane M contains molecular weight markers, the sizes of some of which are indicated at the left of the gel. The lanes are labelled to indicate the growth conditions, plasmid present and presence or absence of IPTG. A 63 kDa band, corresponding to expressed T. pantotropha cytochrome cd\\(_1\\), is visible in lanes 4 and 8. Equal amounts of protein from each sample were loaded in each lane and separated on 8% acrylamide gels. A band corresponding to the size of mature cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) (63 kDa) was apparent only in the samples induced using IPTG from E. coli [pMMBSE], grown either aerobically or anaerobically, and is more prominent in the latter sample. Next, an identical set of samples was separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose by semi-dry electroblotting and analysed by Western blotting using a mouse antibody to P. denitrificans PD1222 cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) (obtained from Thon de Boer, Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam). For comparison, a soluble extract from T. pantotropha grown anaerobically with nitrate was run on the same gel. Only the aerobic and anaerobic samples from E. coli [pMMBSE] that had been induced using IPTG gave a positive reaction for the presence of cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) (Figure 4.9). Figure 4.9: Western blot of protein samples from E. coli JM83, E. coli [pMMB67EH], E. coli [pMMBSEK] and E. coli [pMMBSE], probed using antibody to cytochrome cd\\(_1\\). 40 \\(\\mu\\)g of protein from the cultures indicated above the lanes was separated by electrophoresis on an 8% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to nitrocellulose by semi-dry electroblotting. The membrane was then probed a cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) antibody, detected colorimetrically with a secondary antibody coupled to alkaline phosphatase, as detailed in Materials and Methods. The lane labelled Tp contained 20 \\(\\mu\\)g of protein from a soluble extract of wild-type T. pantotropha grown anaerobically with nitrate. The band in the anaerobic sample was somewhat stronger than that in the aerobic lane, and both bands ran at the same position as the wild type protein. Finally, the samples were analysed for the presence of c-type cytochromes by SDS PAGE followed by haem staining. A sample of purified cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) from T. pantotropha was run on this gel for comparison (Figure 4.10). Figure 4.10: Comparison of the c-type cytochrome content of E. coli [pMMBSE] grown under aerobic or anaerobic conditions. 100 \\(\\mu\\)g of protein from the soluble extracts indicated was separated by electrophoresis on an 8% SDS-PAGE gel and stained for the presence of covalently-attached haem using tetramethylbenzidine and H\\(_2\\)O\\(_2\\), as described in Materials and Methods. The lane labelled Tp contained 5 \\(\\mu\\)g of purified cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) for comparison. Once again, the only positive lanes were those containing protein samples from E. coli [pMMBSE] grown either aerobically or anaerobically. The anaerobic sample stained appreciably more strongly than the aerobic sample, and the mobilities of the haem stained bands were identical to that of the wild-type cytochrome cd\\(_1\\). The soluble extract from anaerobically-grown E. coli [pMMBSE] was pink. A sample of the extract was analysed using UV-visible spectroscopy (Figure 4.11). Figure 4.11: Visible spectrum of soluble extract from E. coli [pMMBSE] grown anaerobically and induced with 1 mM IPTG. 1 ml of soluble extract was prepared from 50 ml of cells and used directly for spectroscopy in 50mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Absorbance maxima are at 416 (not shown), 522, 548 and 554 nm. The spectrum obtained was extremely similar to that of chemically-prepared semi-apo cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) in the reduced form and showed absorbance maxima at 416, 521, 548 and The peaks at 548 and 554 nm were reversed in magnitude when compared to the spectrum of the holoprotein, as was observed with the chemically-prepared semi-apoprotein (Chapter 3, Figure 3.9). To partially purify the expressed semi-apo cytochrome cd\\(_1\\), a 1 l culture of E. coli [pMMBSE] was grown anaerobically, induced with 1 mM IPTG in early exponential phase and harvested at stationary phase, the final A\\(_{650}\\) being around 0.7. A soluble extract was prepared and subjected to ion exchange chromatography on a small DEAE-Sepharose column. The elution profile is shown in Figure 4.12. Figure 4.12: Elution profile during ion exchange chromatography of soluble extract from anaerobically-grown E. coli [pMMBSE] induced using IPTG. 1 l of cells was grown anaerobically to stationary phase and a soluble extract was prepared by sonication in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 followed by ultracentrifugation. The extract was bound to a DEAE-Sepharose CL6B column (1 x 10 cm) equilibrated in the same buffer and eluted with a 200 ml gradient (0-400 mM), also in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0. Symbols: Elution of haem proteins was followed by absorption at 410 nm (■), NaCl gradient (◆). Three major peaks absorbing at 410 nm were apparent, the last which eluted at around 250 mM NaCl which is the expected position for cytochrome cd\\(_1\\). Fractions from this peak were pooled and concentrated, and the spectrum of the pooled fractions was recorded (Figure 4.13). Figure 4.13: UV-visible spectrum of recombinant semi-apo cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) following ion-exchange chromatography. The peak fractions (28-31) in Figure 4.12 were pooled and concentrated to approximately 200 \\(\\mu\\)l. 40 \\(\\mu\\)l of the concentrated material was then diluted 5-fold in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and the spectrum was recorded. Absorbance maxima are at 255, 294, 317, 416, 522,548 and 554 nm. Reconstitution of the semi-apoprotein was attempted using haem d\\(_1\\) purified from a stock of native cytochrome cd\\(_1\\). In the reconstitution experiment 130 \\(\\mu\\)l of concentrated material from the ion exchange column, containing approximately 18.8 \\(\\mu\\)M semi-apo cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) was mixed with 150 \\(\\mu\\)l of haem d\\(_1\\), prepared from approximately 40 mg of partially purified cytochrome cd\\(_1\\), in a total volume of 1 ml containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The solution was incubated at 4 °C for 30 minutes, with gentle mixing by inversion. On mixing the colour of the solution changed from pink to green. The sample was then diluted to 15 ml with 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, concentrated in a 50 kDa cut-off centrifugal filtration unit, diluted once more to 15 ml and reconcentrated to approximately 300 \\(\\mu\\)l, with the aim of retaining cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) plus bound haem and removing unbound haem d\\(_1\\). After concentration, the spectrum of the sample was recorded as isolated and after the addition of sodium dithionite. These spectra are shown in Figure 4.14. Figure 4.14: Visible spectra of recombinant cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) following reconstitution with purified haem d\\(_1\\) (a) as prepared, (b) following reduction using sodium dithionite, compared with (c) native cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) from T. pantotropha. Approximately 2.4 nmol of recombinant semi-apo cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) was reconstituted with haem d\\(_1\\) as described in the main text and concentrated to approximately 300 \\(\\mu\\)l. A 200 \\(\\mu\\)l sample was used to record spectrum (a) and was then reduced using sodium dithionite to record spectrum (b). Spectrum (c) was recorded from 1.5 \\(\\mu\\)M of purified native cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, also reduced using sodium dithionite. In the reduced form, the reconstituted protein exhibited a prominent shoulder at 460 nm and a broad peak at around 625 nm, both of which are diagnostic for the presence of bound haem d\\(_1\\). The activity of the expressed semi-apo cytochrome cd\\(_1\\), reconstituted cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) and native cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) (purified from T. pantotropha) was assayed using reduced methyl viologen as an electron donor. Assay traces for the three samples are shown in Figure 4.15 and estimates of turnover number are summarised below the traces. Figure 4.15: Assays for nitrite reductase activity using reduced methyl viologen as an electron donor: (a) recombinant semi-apo cytochrome cd\\(_1\\), (b) recombinant cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) following reconstitution with d\\(_1\\) haem, (c) native cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) purified from T. pantotropha. All assays were performed anaerobically in a volume of 1 ml as described in Materials and Methods. The traces show the decrease in absorbance at 600 nm as the methyl viologen becomes oxidised. The reaction rates used for the calculations described in the main text were obtained by subtraction of the drift rate (before nitrite addition) from the initial rate (after nitrite addition) 4.3 Discussion When grown aerobically all of the E. coli strains exhibited similar growth rates (Figure 4.6). The final optical density reached was similar for all strains carrying a plasmid selected by ampicillin resistance (pMMB67EH or pMMBSE), but slightly lower for plasmids selected by kanamycin resistance (pMMBSEK). As no cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) was expressed from plasmid pMMBSEK (Figure 4.9), this effect seems likely to result from the stress of countering the antibiotic. Thus it is concluded that, aerobically, the nirS gene exerts no toxic effects on E. coli JM83. Under anaerobic conditions, a greater disparity was observed between cultures of E. coli when compared with cultures carrying the different plasmids. Cells carrying the parent plasmid pMMB67EH, selected by ampicillin resistance, showed a pronounced lag when compared to the wild-type strain, taking around 24 hours to reach stationary phase as compared to around 16 hours for the wild-type (Figure 4.7) and the final optical density reached was slightly lower. This again suggests that the combined stresses of growing anaerobically in the minimal medium and countering the effects of the antibiotic acted together to slow the growth of the cells. Optical densities of cultures containing anaerobically grown E. coli [pMMBSE] and E. coli [pMMBSEK] could not be accurately determined because the cells in these cultures tended to sediment and adhere strongly to the walls of the tube. However, the final density of these cultures did appear to be somewhat lower than that of E. coli [pMMB67EH] grown anaerobically. The reduced growth rate and adherence to the walls of the tube occurred in E. coli [pMMBSE] and E. coli [pMMBSEK] irrespective of the presence of IPTG and so do not appear to be a consequence of expression of the nirS gene. It seems that cells in the latter two cultures were experiencing stress arising from an as-yet unidentified factor. One possible cause might be expression of the truncated nirE gene during anaerobic growth. The first 648 bp (encoding 216 amino acids) of the nirE gene are present on the plasmids pMMBSE and pMMBSEK and it is possible that the truncated gene product is toxic to the cells. Plasmids containing the upstream region of the nirE gene have also been observed to reduce yields of cells and DNA during routine cloning procedures in E. coli (Dr. Simon Baker, personal communication). A Western blot of extracts from cells grown under various conditions (Figure 4.9) showed that cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) was expressed only from pMMBSE when induced using IPTG. No cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) was detectable without induction, indicating that the endogenous nirS promoter is not functional in E. coli under either aerobic or anaerobic conditions. Further evidence for this assertion is supplied by strains carrying the plasmid pMMBSEK, a construct where a kanamycin cassette lies between the tac promoter and the NNR box. In this construct, transcription from the kanamycin gene promoter would be expected to interfere with transcription from the upstream tac promoter, but not with the downstream endogenous promoter region, were it to be active. This assumes that the NNR box and downstream regions contain all the necessary information for transcriptional activation of the nirS gene; Chapter 7 discusses the region in more detail, but by analogy to FNR-activated genes it is believed that the above assumption is true. In cultures of E. coli [pMMBSEK] no expression was observed under any growth condition, even when induced with IPTG. Under anaerobic growth conditions expression of cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) in E. coli was enhanced, as judged by Western blotting. E. coli has only been shown quite recently to synthesise a range of previously uncharacterised c-type cytochromes and it has been demonstrated that these are most abundant during anaerobic growth (Iobbi-Nivol et al., 1994).269 In the case of the endogenous c-type cytochromes the increase under anaerobic growth conditions is the result of several factors, including activation by FNR and other transcriptional activators, such as the NarX/L family (Darwin and Stewart, 1995).274 However, for cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) these factors are unlikely to be operative as the cloned fragment contains only the NNR box, which is probably not recognised by the E. coli FNR protein (Spiro, 1994).186 The increased amounts of cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) under anaerobic growth conditions are due in large part to the increased expression levels of the cytochrome c biogenesis genes under these conditions (Thony-Meyer et al., 1995).275 The amount of covalently-attached c haem increased in parallel with the increased levels of cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) polypeptide under anaerobic conditions (Figure 4.10), indicating that haem supply is increased anaerobically in E. coli. Previous studies have shown that expression of the hemA gene in E. coli, which encodes glutamyl-tRNA dehydrogenase, a haem precursor biosynthetic enzyme, is enhanced 2.5-fold under anaerobic as compared to aerobic growth conditions (Darie and Gunsalus, 1994).276 It has also been demonstrated that expression of cytochrome b\\(_5\\) in E. coli provides a “haem sink,” which increases the cellular haem content (Woodard and Dailey, 1995),277 and a similar effect may result from cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) expression. Western blotting and protein staining of the protein extracts showed that the expressed cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) was the same size as native cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) from T. pantotropha (Figures 4.8, 4.9). This indicates that the targeting sequence was recognised by the periplasmic export complex of E. coli and efficiently cleaved. It also suggests that the protein is exported to the periplasm. The fact that c-type haem is covalently attached also suggests correct targeting, as attachment of c-type haem is believed to take place in the periplasm (Page and Ferguson, 1990).278 Thus it appears that recognition of the foreign c-type haem attachment site, processing and export to the periplasm can all occur in E. coli, implying that the steps are fundamentally similar to those in P. denitrificans and other Gram-negative bacteria. Similar observations have been made for other c-type cytochromes although the presence or absence of the c-type haem seems to depend very much on the particular protein. Examples of c-type cytochromes that have been successfully expressed as the holoprotein in E. coli include cytochrome c\\(_2\\) from Rhodobacter sphaeroides (Grisshammer et al., 1991,279 though not the same protein from R. viridis), cytochrome c\\(_{550}\\) from P. denitrificans (Sambongi et al., 1996),280 cytochrome c\\(_{553}\\) (Pollock and Voordouw, 1994)281 and DcrA (Fu et al., 1994)282 from Desulfovibrio vulgaris, mitochondrial cytochrome c from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sambongi et al., 1996)280 and cytochrome c\\(_{550}\\) from Thiobacillus versutus (Ubbink et al., 1992).283 The optimal growth conditions also seem to be specific to each case; cytochrome c\\(_2\\) required anaerobic growth, whilst T. versutus cytochrome c\\(_550\\) was optimally expressed semi-anaerobically and the D. vulgaris cytochrome was optimally expressed under aerobic growth conditions. These observations have led to the suggestion that successful covalent haem attachment in E. coli may depend on the physical properties of the apoprotein. Anomalously, cytochrome c\\(_{552}\\) from the thermophilic bacterium Hydrogenobacter thermophilus can apparently attach c-type haem in the cytoplasm of E. coli, as demonstrated using expression from a gene in which the periplasmic largeting sequence has been deleted (Sambongi and Ferguson, 1994).284 This is believed to result from spontaneous covalent attachment to the apoprotein, which possesses a highly ordered structure due to its thermostability. Heterologous expression of c-type cytochromes is thus similar to that of other metalloproteins which have been expressed in E. coli, in that the complexity of the both the protein and its endogenous biosynthetic pathway both come to bear on the ease of expression. To give some examples, a number of proteins possessing the molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide cofactor (found in the dissimilatory nitrate reductases) have been successfully expressed (Garrett and Rajagapolan, 1994),285 as E. coli possesses several enzymes that contain the cofactor (and therefore the biosynthetic machinery to process such proteins) Iron-sulphur proteins have also been expressed relatively easily (Vidakovic et al., 1996),286 as have simple copper proteins such as pseudoazurin (Leung et al., 1997),287 but more complex copper proteins such as nitrous oxide reductase are expressed as the apoprotein (Viebrock and Zumft, 1988)288 because of the absence of endogenous accessory gene products. A spectrum of the soluble extract from anaerobically grown E. coli [pMMBSE] that had been induced using IPTG is shown in Figure 4.11. The quality of the spectrum was quite surprising, as it was very similar to that of pure semi-apo cytochrome cd\\(_1\\), suggesting that there was very little contamination by endogenous c-type cytochromes and that the expressed cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) was the major cytochrome c in the cells. In E. coli 712, a strain of E. coli that over-produces cytochromes c, five endogenous c-type cytochromes can be detected by haem staining after SDS-PAGE (Iobbi-Nivol et al., 1994).269 It appears that these cytochromes are less abundant in E. coli JM83, though a faint band corresponding to the nrfA gene product (a tetra- or possibly pentahaem nitrite reductase, Darwin et al., 1993)289 could be seen in some haem-stained extracts from E. coli [pMMBSE]. The expressed cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) shows the same characteristic absorption spectrum as the reduced chemically prepared form, with peaks at 416, 521, 548 and 554 nm, all originating from the c-haem, and the reversal relative to the holoprotein in the amplitude of the split peak at 548-554 nm noted in Chapter 3. Additionally, a peak can be seen at 317 nm. This peak is ascribed to low-spin reduced c-haem (Barber et al., 1976)290 and cannot normally be seen in the chemically-prepared semi-apo protein, as the addition of reducing agents such as sodium dithionite masks absorbance in this region. The expressed cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) protein is reduced as isolated and remains stable in this form for several days at -20 °C. The same property and the 317 nm absorbance band have also been noted for the recombinant enzyme from Ps. aeruginosa when expressed in Ps. putida (Silvestrini et al., 1992).268 When assayed with reduced methyl viologen, expressed semi-apo cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) is devoid of detectable nitrite reductase activity (Figure 4.15). This is unsurprising, as the d\\(_1\\) haem has previously been shown to be the site of this reaction (Silvestrini et al., 1990),161 although it has been reported that about 5% of the cytochrome c oxidase activity of native cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) can be restored to the chemically prepared semi-apo protein by reconstitution using a-type haem (Hill and Wharton, 1978).118 However, in the case of the expressed protein in E. coli it seems that alternative haems are not inserted in vivo, as no activity was present and the only spectroscopic features were those of c-haem. In contrast to this result, Ohshima et al. (1993)140 reported that expression of the nirS gene from P. denitrificans IFO 12442 in E. coli gave measurable nitrite reductase and nitric oxide activities. However, the construct used in these experiments contained 10 kbp of downstream DNA in addition to the nirS gene and as the same downstream region in P. denitrificans PD1222 contains the genes for haem d\\(_1\\) biosynthesis (de Boer et al., 1994),141 it may be that the same genes are present in P. denitrificans IFO 12242, thus allowing the formation of some active cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) in E. coli. The nitric oxide reductase activity is harder to explain, as the genes for this enzyme are upstream of the nirS gene in P. denitrificans PD1222 (de Boer et al., 1996)171 (and in T. pantotropha, as shown by mapping the plasmid pTNIR3, Figure 4.2). It should be noted that the activities reported by Ohshima et al. (1993)140 are extremely low (in the order of units per gram of protein) and are barely above background level. Furthermore, the expressed protein was detected only by Western blotting and all work was performed with crude extracts, with no direct demonstration that holoprotein was formed (e.g. by partial purification and spectroscopy). The results of Ohshima et al. (1993)140 should therefore be viewed with some scepticism. To reconstitute expressed cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) using haem d\\(_1\\) a soluble extract was prepared from 1 l of cells and partially purified on a small ion exchange column, using the same elution conditions as those employed during the purification of native cytochrome cd\\(_1\\). Figure 4.12 shows the elution profile from this column, which confirms that semi-apo cytochrome cd\\(_1\\), eluting at around 250 mM NaCl, was the major cytochrome c in the extract. SDS-PAGE of the peak fractions followed by staining for protein and haem showed the presence of a number of other proteins in the sample, although the expressed cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) was the only haem protein in the peak (data not shown). Further purification of the sample was not considered to be a sensible option because of the relatively low amounts of expressed protein obtained (about 1 mg from 1 l). Other groups have reported reconstitution of whole cell extracts (Glockner et al., 1993),63 so purity of the sample was not considered to be of paramount importance. On mixing purified haem d\\(_1\\) and expressed cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) the pink colour was lost from the semi-apoprotein as the reduced c-haem was oxidised by the added haem d\\(_1\\). After removal of excess haem d\\(_1\\), the spectrum of the now oxidised protein was recorded (Figure 4.14a). The absorbance maxima were at similar positions to those in the native oxidised protein (407, 525 and 640 nm), although the peak at 407 nm was somewhat broader. The rise at around 640 nm due to the d\\(_1\\) haem was not as pronounced as that seen in the native enzyme, although there was clearly some absorption in this region. However, there was a clear shoulder at around 440 nm, indicative of absorption by the d\\(_1\\) haem. The spectroscopic features became much clearer when the sample was reduced with sodium dithionite (Figure 4.14b). The double peak of the c-type haem was apparent, and the split peaks were of similar magnitude, which is indicative of holo cytochrome cd\\(_1\\). There was also a peak at around 625 nm and the shoulder at 440 nm moved to 460 nm and increased in size. All of these features indicate that at least some of the protein has bound the d\\(_1\\) haem to yield holoenzyme, with the 625 nm peak being shifted due to the binding of breakdown products from the sodium dithionite (Parr et al., 1974).291 However, the attenuated size of the 460 nm shoulder and 625 nm peak as compared to the native reduced protein (Figure 4.14c) suggests that not all of the enzyme has been reconstituted, and the spectrum is therefore a composite of the holo- and semi-apo forms. The holo- and semi-apo forms of cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) can be further separated using ion exchange chromatography, as the holo- form is more negatively charged and so binds to a DEAE-Sepharose column more tightly. However, this step was not performed, again due to the low amounts of material obtained. The sample was assayed for nitrite reductase activity, using reduced methyl viologen as electron donor and a trace from this assay is shown in Figure 4.15. The reconstituted sample is clearly active as a nitrite reductase. Estimates of turnover number are quite difficult to obtain from this experiment, because the mixture of reconstituted holoprotein and remaining semi-apoprotein means that the amount of reconstituted material cannot be estimated spectrophotometrically, using previously determined extinction coefficients for cytochrome cd\\(_1\\). However, a rough calculation was made as follows. 50 \\(\\mu\\)l of reconstituted material was assayed in a volume of 1 ml, and a methyl viologen oxidation rate of 0.109 \\(\\mu\\)mol min\\(^{-1}\\) was recorded. Assuming that the absorbance of the reduced semi-apoprotein is not greatly different at 548 nm to that of the holoprotein, the extinction coefficient at 548 nm is 48.95 mM\\(^{-1}\\) cm\\(^{-1}\\), indicating that the material used in the 1 ml reconstitution reaction contained approximately 2.4 nmol of cytochrome cd\\(_1\\). As 50 \\(\\mu\\)l of this (= 0.4 nmol) was used in the assay, the turnover number is 109/0.4 giving approximately 273 \\(\\mu\\)mol of methyl viologen oxidised per minute per \\(\\mu\\)mol of total cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) (i.e. reconstituted plus semi-apo protein). This is a similar figure to a typical assay of native cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) from T. pantotropha. However, as already noted the spectrum of the reconstituted material (Figure 4.14b) differs to that of the native protein, indicating that not all of the protein has been reconstituted. Table 4.3 shows the ratios of some of the peak absorbances of the semi-apo, reconstituted and native proteins in the reduced and oxidised states. Table 4.3: Comparison of the ratios of the absorbance maxima in (left) the reduced and (right) the oxidised states of native holo- and chemically prepared semi-apo cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) from T. pantotropha with those of the recombinant protein from E. coli. Data for native cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) was calculated using extinction coefficients obtained from Alrik Koppenhöfer; the absorbances for the recombinant protein were obtained from the spectra presented in this chapter. Absorbance ratio native cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) reduced expressed semi-apo cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) reduced reconstituted expressed cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) reduced 418:522 7.48 5.73 3.36 418:548 6.60 5.72 3.32 418:554 6.68 5.62 3.32 418:650 8.06 4.25 548:650 1.22 1.28 554:650 1.21 1.28 Absorbance ratio native cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) oxidised reconstituted expressed cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) reduced 407:525 6.84 2.59 406:645 14.44 526:645 15.31 The figures indicate that the ratio of the Soret peak (the absorbance of which is contributed to by both c and d\\(_1\\) haems) to peaks composed primarily of absorbance from the c haem is lower by a factor of about two in the reconstituted protein compared to native cytochrome cd\\(_1\\). The spectroscopic features of the reduced reconstituted enzyme thus allow the crude estimate that the reconstitution was about 50% efficient. A substantial amount of the maximum activity was, therefore, recovered following reconstitution of the expressed semi-apo enzyme, although it is considerably lower than that reported for reconstitutions of the chemically-prepared semi-apo enzyme from Ps. aeruginosa (Hill and Wharton, 1978)118 and Ps. stutzeri JM300 (Weeg-Aerssens et al., 1991),251 in which almost 100% recovery was reported. There are a number of reasons why this might be the case. First, no attempt was made to optimise the procedure. Partial reconstitution of the recombinant semi-apoprotein was achieved quite easily in the present work, but attempts to reconstitute the chemically-prepared semi-apo cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) from T. pantotropha in this laboratory have proved to be technically challenging and success requires quite specific salt concentrations, buffer, haem d\\(_1\\):protein ratios and pH (A. Koppenhöfer, personal communication). It is probable that the procedure for reconstituting the recombinant semi-apo enzyme could be improved considerably by varying the conditions of the experiment. Secondly, the partial purity of the enzyme sample from E. coli may mean that some of the haem d\\(_1\\) bound non-specifically to other proteins and so was not available for reconstitution. Bearing the above points in mind, it is concluded that expression in E. coli is a viable system for producing recombinant holo-cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) in the absence of an alternative system which can express the holoenzyme. The value of using E. coli is in the ability to express enzymically-inactive mutants of cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) which could then be reconstituted, as outlined in the introduction to this chapter. There are a few disadvantages to the approach, one of which is that large quantities of native cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) must be purified in order to extract haem d\\(_1\\) for reconstitution (though in the above experiments, relatively small quantities were used due to the scale of the experiment). A second problem is the possibility of heterogeneity between reconstituted samples which may make it difficult to interpret the results of some experiments, such as enzyme kinetics. This could probably be overcome to some extent by optimisation and standardisation of the procedure, though it is unlikely that reconstituted samples will be suitable for crystallisation unless the reconstitution is very uniform and efficient. The yield of expressed protein in the present work was quite low (around 1 mg l\\(^{-1}\\)) and could probably be improved given time to optimise the conditions. Increased amounts of expressed protein would allow further purification of the sample, to reduce the possibility of non-specific binding of haem d\\(_1\\) outlined above. In the only other quantitative study of heterologous nirS expression, around 3 mg l\\(^{-1}\\) of recombinant protein was obtained from cells of Ps. putida (Silvestrini et al., 1992).268 Improvements in yield using the present construct may be achieved by varying the time of induction with IPTG or possibly varying the IPTG concentration. Investigation of expression levels in other strains of E. coli which overproduce c-type cytochromes, such as E. coli 7120 and its derivatives, Darwin et al., 1993)289 might also be productive. The present construct, pMMBSE, is somewhat inconvenient; it would be better to try and clone only the nirS structural gene under the tac promoter, without the upstream region. This region contains an inverted repeat adjacent to the NNR box and removal of such structures has been demonstrated to improve in other cases (Yamamoto et al., 1987).292 Removal of the truncated nirE gene may also be advantageous in view of the possible toxicity effects discussed previously. In addition to these experiments, a different vector system might be used. The pMMB67EH vector is quite large and cumbersome and several newer alternatives are now available, such as the pET vector systems (Studier et al., 1990),293 in which transcription is driven from a T7 RNA polymerase promoter, using modified E. coli strains that have the gene for this polymerase integrated into their genomic DNA. Figures for protein expression in the range of tens of milligrams per litre are frequently quoted for the latter system (though success always depends on the specific nature of the protein under investigation) and it would be of interest to investigate the expression of cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) in such a system.

There are a number of disadvantages to this approach, in particular the requirement for large quantities of purified d\\(_1\\) haem which can only be obtained from several tens of milligrams of purified cytochrome cd\\(_1\\). Additionally, the expression of the protein and the reconstitution protocol require substantial optimisation; heterogeneity in the reconstituted material may thus be a problem during crystallisation or attempts to compare thoroughly different samples. An ideal expression system would, therefore, synthesise holo cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) that contained both the c- and d\\(_1\\) haems, in a form that could be easily purified, assayed for activity and crystallised for structural studies so as to compare site-directed mutants of the enzyme with the native protein. One approach to this may be to express the cloned nirS gene in a heterologous host which also contains an endogenous cytochrome cd\\(_1\\)-type nitrite reductase. This requires a denitrifying organism that is genetically amenable. It would be hoped that the cloned gene would be expressed at a sufficiently high level and that the recombinant protein would be translocated to the periplasm, where c-haem could be covalently attached. Additionally, a sufficient pool of free d\\(_1\\) haem would exist that could be sequestrated and incorporated into the recombinant cytochrome cd\\(_1\\). Finally the process should not compromise the growth of the host organism and the recombinant protein should be physically different to the endogenous nitrite reductase, so that it can be separated and purified for further analysis. The experiments described in this chapter were designed to investigate the expression of the nirS gene from T. pantotropha in the host Ps. aeruginosa PAO1. The latter organism was selected using the criteria outlined above; it contains a cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) nitrite reductase (Horio et al., 1961)294 and systems for genetic manipulation have been developed in the organism (Rothmel et al., 1991).295 Additionally, the isoelectric point of the cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) from this organism (approximately 7.0, Hull and Wharton, 1993)296 is much more basic than that of the enzyme from T. pantotropha (predicted from the protein sequence to be 4.75), and so the expressed protein should be separable from the host cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) using ion exchange chromatography. The transformation of Ps. aeruginosa PAO1 with the expression plasmid pMMBSE is described and the remainder of the chapter focuses on the expression of the cloned nirS gene under different growth conditions, attempts to partially purify the expressed protein and initial analyses of the spectroscopic features and activity of the enzyme obtained. 5.2 Results 5.2.1 Transformation of Ps. aeruginosa PAO1 with the plasmid pMMBSE The plasmid used to investigate expression of the nirS gene from T. pantotropha in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 was pMMBSE, construction and details of which were described in Chapter 4. The plasmid was transferred to Ps. aeruginosa by mobilisation from the donor E. coli strain S17-1. Mated cells were plated on Pseudomonas selective medium (Materials and Methods), containing 250 \\(\\mu\\)g ml\\(^{-1}\\) carbenicillin, to obtain colonies of Ps. aeruginosa containing the plasmid. Single colonies so selected were picked, grown up in LB medium plus 250 \\(\\mu\\)g ml\\(^{-1}\\) carbenicillin and tested for the presence of plasmid pMMBSE using plasmid purification (Promega Wizard miniprep) followed by restriction analysis with the enzyme HindIII. Figure 5.1 shows agarose gels of the digests from several colonies of Ps. aeruginosa. Figure 5.1: Re-isolation of intact plasmid pMMBSE from Ps. aeruginosa PAO1. Plasmid pMMBSE was introduced into Ps. aeruginosa PAO1 by conjugal transfer from E. coli S17-1. Following selection, the plasmid was isolated using the Promega Wizard miniprep kit and digested with HindIII. The fragments were separated by electrophoresis on a 0.8% agarose gel. This digest produces two fragments of approximately 9.3 and 1.9 kbp, seen clearly in lanes 1-3, 5 and 6. Lanes III and II contain DNA size standards, the sizes of some of which are indicated at the left of the gel. Wizard minipreps from Ps. aeruginosa PAO1 were of consistently good quality and always yielded the expected fragments from the pMMBSE digest. 5.2.2 Analysis of expression from pMMBSE in Ps. aeruginosa PAO1 under different growth conditions Ps. aeruginosa was found to be a convenient organism for the study of expression under different growth conditions, as it grew vigorously both aerobically in LB medium and anaerobically in LB plus 50 mM potassium nitrate. To analyse the growth of transformed cells, 50 ml cultures of Ps. aeruginosa PAO1 and Ps. aeruginosa PAO1 [pMMBSE] were grown either aerobically, aerobically plus 50 mM KNO\\(_3\\) or anaerobically. Additionally, cultures carrying the pMMBSE plasmid under each condition could be induced using 1 mM IPTG during the early exponential growth phase (Rothmel et al., 1991).295 This set of conditions gave rise to nine different cultures, detailed in Table 5.1. Table 5.1: Different growth conditions used to compare the growth of Ps. aeruginosa PAO1 with that of Ps. aeruginosa [pMMBSE] Cultures contained Ps. aeruginosa PAO1, Ps. aeruginosa [pMMBSE] or Ps. aeruginosa [pMMBSE] induced using 1 mM IPTG. Each of these were grown aerobically in LB medium, aerobically in LB medium plus 50 mM KNO\\(_3\\) or anaerobically in LB medium plus 50 mM KNO\\(_3\\), giving a total of nine different cultures as shown. Culture number Growth conditions pMMBSE present IPTG added 1 aerobic n n 2 y n 3 y y 4 aerobic + 50 mM KNO\\(_3\\) n n 5 y n 6 y y 7 anaerobic n n 8 y n 9 y y Growth was recorded by the increase in absorbance at 650 nm until stationary phase was reached and the resulting curves are shown in Figure 5.2. Figure 5.2: Comparison of the growth curves of Ps. aeruginosa and Ps. aeruginosa [pMMBSE] under different growth conditions. Overnight cultures were inoculated at a dilution of 1/100 into 50 ml of medium and growth was followed by the change in absorbance at 650 nm (logarithmic scale). Symbols: (◆) Ps. aeruginosa aerobic, (■) Ps. aeruginosa [pMMBSE] aerobic, (▲) Ps. aeruginosa [pMMBSE] aerobic + induced, (◇) Ps. aeruginosa aerobic + nitrate, (□) Ps. aeruginosa [pMMBSE] aerobic + nitrate, (△) Ps. aeruginosa [pMMBSE] aerobic + nitrate + induced, (diamond/strikethrough) Ps. aeruginosa anaerobic. (square/strikethrough) Ps, aeruginosa [pMMBSE] anaerobic, (triangle/strikethrough) Ps. aeruginosa [pMMBSE] anaerobic + induced. Aerobically, the growth of all cultures was the same, regardless of the presence of IPTG or nitrate. However, anaerobically, Ps. aeruginosa [pMMBSE] showed a marked growth defect, entered stationary phase much earlier than the wild-type and reached a lower final optical density of around 0.6. This occurred even in the absence of induction with IPTG. To investigate the defect further, cultures of Ps. aeruginosa and Ps. aeruginosa [pMMBSE] plus or minus IPTG were again grown anaerobically over a 13 hour period and their growth curves recorded. To estimate the level of nitrite reductase activity in each culture, 1 ml samples taken at each time point on the growth curve were harvested and the supernatant was assayed colorimetrically for the presence of nitrite. These data are shown in Figure 5.3. Figure 5.3: Comparison of (a) the growth curve and (b) nitrite accumulation of Ps. aeruginosa with that of Ps. aeruginosa [pMMBSE]. Growth is shown as absorbance at 650 nm (logarithmic scale) against time after inoculation. For nitrite determination, 1 ml samples were harvested at each time point and the supernatant was assayed for nitrite colorimetrically (Materials and Methods). Symbols: (◆) Ps. aeruginosa, (■) Ps. aeruginosa [pMMBSE], (▲) Ps. aeruginosa [pMMBSE] induced using 1 mM IPTG. In all samples, the nitrite concentration rose to a maximum of around 3.4 mM near the end of the exponential growth phase. In wild-type cells, it then declined very rapidly, to undetectable levels within two hours. In contrast nitrite concentration remained near the maximum level reached in Ps. aeruginosa [pMMBSE], regardless of induction, throughout stationary phase. Samples of these cultures assayed after a further 12 hours contained similar levels of nitrite (not shown). The nine different cultures used to obtain the first set of growth curves were harvested and total soluble extracts were prepared by sonication and ultracentrifugation. Samples from each extract were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained for protein using Coomassie Blue (Figure 5.4). Figure 5.4: Comparison of the protein content of Ps. aeruginosa with that of Ps. aeruginosa [pMMBSE] under different growth conditions. 40 \\(\\mu\\)g of protein from the soluble extracts indicated was separated by electrophoresis on an 8% SDS-PAGE gel and stained for protein using Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250. The lane labelled M contained molecular weight markers, the sizes of which are indicated at the left of the gel. A 63 kDa band, corresponding to expressed T. pantotropha cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) is visible in lanes 4 and 7. The region in which cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) is found stained quite densely, but a clear band of 63 kDa, (which corresponds to the size of mature cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) from T. pantotropha) was visible in the induced sample grown aerobically and anaerobically with nitrate. The same band was not clearly seen in induced, anaerobically grown samples due to their poor growth (data not shown). A band running with slightly lower mobility was observed in the samples from wild-type cells grown aerobically plus nitrate and anaerobically; this band corresponded to the endogenous cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) which has a slightly lower molecular weight than its counterpart from T. pantotropha (Table 3.4. Chapter 3). To compare the effect on expression of growth under either aerobic or anaerobic conditions an identical set of samples, except for Ps. aeruginosa [pMMBSE] grown aerobically with nitrate, were again separated by SDS-PAGE under the same conditions, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane by semi-dry electroblotting and probed with the P. denitrificans cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) antibody. The Western blot is shown in Figure 5.5. Figure 5.5: Western blot of protein samples from Ps. aeruginosa or Ps. aeruginosa [pMMBSE] grown under different growth conditions, probed using antibody to cytochrome cd\\(_1\\). 40 \\(\\mu\\)g of protein from the cultures indicated was loaded in each lane and separated by SDS-PAGE in an 8% acrylamide gel. The samples were then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane by semi-dry electroblotting and probed with antibody as detailed in Materials and Methods. Only two samples tested positive with this antibody, those from Ps. aeruginosa [pMMBSE] grown aerobically or anaerobically and induced with IPTG. Each sample showed a band of the same mobility as native purified cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) from T. pantotropha, with a more intense staining reaction in the anaerobic sample. The latter sample also showed a smeared high molecular weight band, near the top of the gel. Next, the c-type cytochrome content of each sample was analysed by SDS-PAGE followed by staining for covalently attached haem. In all samples grown aerobically the only detectable band was that of the low molecular weight cytochrome c\\(_{551}\\) (9 kDa); this was seen only on gels of 10% acrylamide or more (not shown). 100 \\(\\mu\\)g of protein from the anaerobically and aerobically plus nitrate grown samples was separated on 8% acrylamide gels and stained for haem (Figure 5.6). Figure 5.6: Comparison of the c-type cytochrome content of Ps. aeruginosa with that of Ps. aeruginosa [pMMBSE] under different growth conditions. 100 \\(\\mu\\)g of protein from the cultures indicated was loaded in each lane and separated by SDS-PAGE in a 6% acrylamide gel. The gel was stained for covalently-attached haem as described in Materials and Methods. Lane Tp contained 5 \\(\\mu\\)g of purified cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) from T. pantotropha. A doublet of around 60 kDa was seen in the lane containing extract from anaerobically-grown Ps. aeruginosa and in the extract from cells grown aerobically with nitrate; this doublet corresponded to the endogenous cytochrome cd\\(_1\\). In samples from cells containing plasmid pMMBSE but not induced with IPTG, the intensity of this band was greatly attenuated (lane 2). When the cultures were induced (lane 3), the band was again attenuated and a new doublet of slightly higher molecular weight appeared. The latter doublet stained most strongly in the aerobically grown cultures plus nitrate (lane 6) and had the same mobility as purified cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) from T. pantotropha (lane 7). These experiments showed that the nirS gene from T. pantotropha expressed to a hich level in Ps. aeruginosa PAO1 when induced with IPTG, particularly under anaerobic denitrifying growth conditions. The next step was to attempt a partial purification of the recombinant protein. A 1 l culture of Ps. aeruginosa [pMMBSE] was grown anaerobically to early exponential phase, induced with 1 mM IPTG and grown for a further 10 hours to a final A\\(_{650}\\) of about 0.8. The cells were harvested and an attempt to prepare a periplasmic extract was made by spheroplasting in the normal way, except for the omission of EDTA which was found to cause cell lysis. The extract obtained was extremely pale brown in colour, and so it was decided to improve the extraction at the expense of initial purity by using a total soluble extract, prepared as before by sonication and ultracentrifugation. This extract was applied to a small DEAE-Sepharose column (1 x 10 cm), previously equilibrated with 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, washed with several column volumes of the same buffer and eluted with a 250 ml linear gradient of 0-400 mM NaCl in the same buffer. However, it was noticed that after application of the sample to the column the flow rate became very irregular. The elution profile, obtained by measuring the A\\(_{410}\\) of the fractions was also very irregular and no peaks corresponding to the elution of haem proteins could be resolved. The problem of poor column flow may have occurred for a number of reasons. The initial hypothesis was that the aggregated material observed on the Western blot of anaerobically grown induced cell extracts may have been causing a blockage in the column. However, the aggregate was not observed in aerobic samples and as it is known that in Ps. aeruginosa holocytochrome cd\\(_1\\) is expressed aerobically if nitrate is present (Zennaro et al., 1993),215 it was thought possible that some recombinant holoprotein might be produced under the same conditions, but without the risk of aggregation. To achieve this a 1 l culture was grown in a 5 1 flask with low shaking (100 rpm), induced as before and harvested after 10 hours. Additional steps were taken to reduce the risk of poor performance during the ion exchange chromatography. First, as lysed cells of Ps. aeruginosa produce substantial amounts of polysaccharides and DNA, the harvested cells were broken by a freeze-thaw lysozyme treatment, followed by incubation with 100 U of DNase. This material was filtered before application to a slightly larger DEAE-Sepharose column (2 x 12 cm) in order to reduce irregularities in the flow due to surface tension at the column walls. The material was then eluted using a 250 ml linear gradient of 0-400 mM NaCl as before. This time a clean, well-resolved elution profile was obtained, as shown in Figure 5.7. Figure 5.7: Elution profile during ion-exchange chromatography of soluble extract from Ps. aeruginosa [pMMBSE] grown semi-aerobically with nitrate and induced using IPTG. A 1 l culture of Ps. aeruginosa [pMMBSE] was grown semi-aerobically with 50 mM KNO\\(_3\\) and induced with 1 mM IPTG. A total soluble extract was prepared and bound to a DEAE-Sepharose column (2 x 12 cm) previously equilibrated with 50 mM Tris-HCI pH 8.0, washed with several column volumes of the same buffer and eluted using a 250 ml linear gradient of 0-400 mM NaCl. Symbols: (■) absorbance at 410 nm, (◆) NaCl concentration Three peaks of absorbance at 410 nm were seen, eluting at approximately 125, 225 and 250 mM NaCl. Fractions from around the top of peaks 2 and 3 were run on an 8% acrylamide SDS PAGE gel, along with a sample of total soluble extract from Ps. aeruginosa [pMMBSE] grown anaerobically and induced with 1 mM IPTG, and stained for covalently-bound haem (Figure 5.8). Figure 5.8: Analysis of the c-type cytochrome content in the elution profile of soluble extract from Ps. aeruginosa [pMMBSE] following ion exchange chromatography. 15 \\(\\mu\\)l of each fraction was loaded in each lane and separated by SDS-PAGE in an 8% acrylamide gel. Lanes are numbered according to the fraction loaded and the peak from which the fractions were taken is indicated. Lane S contained 100 \\(\\mu\\)g of total soluble extract from Ps. aeruginosa [pMMBSE] grown anaerobically and induced with 1 mM IPTG. In lane S the endogenous (60 kDa) and recombinant (63 kDa) cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) are indicated. Fractions from both peaks showed a single haem-staining doublet with identical mobility. The doublet was also seen in the total soluble extract and appeared slightly higher in the gel than a second band which corresponded to the endogenous cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) at about 60 kDa. The doublet in the samples from both peak 2 and peak 3 therefore corresponded to expressed T. pantotropha cytochrome cd\\(_1\\). The eluted fractions from the DEAE-Sepharose column were very dilute and so the top fractions from peaks 2 and 3 were pooled and each pool was concentrated to about 1 ml by centrifugation in an Amicon-30 microconcentrator. Following concentration, the material from peak 2 was pale pink, whereas that from peak 3 was orange-brown. The spectra of the concentrated fractions were recorded. Figure 5.9a and 5.9b shows a spectrum of the material from peak 2; absorbance maxima were observed at 289, 415, 522, 548 and 554 nm. Figure 5.9: UV-visible spectrum of concentrated fractions eluting under peak 2 following DEAE-Sepharose chromatography. Five fractions from the top of peak 2 (Figure 5.7) were pooled and concentrated to approximately 1 ml by centrifugation in an Amicon-30 microconcentrator Absorbance maxima were observed at 289 (not shown), 415, 522 548 and 554 nm. (b) is an expansion of the region from 440-800 nm in (a), showing the split \\(\\alpha\\)-peak and the absence of d\\(_1\\) haem absorbance features. No change in the spectrum was observed on the addition of sodium dithionite (not shown). The spectrum was virtually identical to that of the T. pantotropha semi-apo cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) expressed in E. coli (Chapter 4, Figure 4.13). No change in this spectrum was observed on the addition of sodium dithionite. Figure 5.10a shows the spectrum from peak 3, with 288 409 and 523 nm, and smaller peaks at 547 and 628 nm. Figure 5.10: UV-visible spectrum of concentrated fractions eluting under peak 2 following DEAE-Sepharose chromatography. Five fractions from the top of peak 2 (Figure 5.7) were pooled and concentrated to approximately 1 ml by centrifugation in an Amicon-30 microconcentrator Absorbance maxima were observed at 289 (not shown), 415, 522 548 and 554 nm. (b) is an expansion of the region from 440-800 nm in (a), showing the split \\(\\alpha\\)-peak and the absence of d\\(_1\\) haem absorbance features.

Figure 5.10 (a) UV-visible spectrum of concentrated fractions eluting under peak 3 after DEAE-Sepharose chromatography, as isolated and (b) after the addition of excess sodium dithionite Five fractions from the top of peak 3 (Figure 5.7) were pooled and concentrated to approximately 1 ml by centrifugation in an Amicon-10 microconcentrator. Absorbance maxima were observed at 286, 409, 523 and 547 nm in the as-isolated form, and 418, 522, 548, 554 and 607 nm in the dithionite-reduced form. Sodium dithionite was gradually added to a 200 \\(\\mu\\)l sample of the concentrated peak 3 fractions and the spectrum was recorded until no further changes were observed. Figure 5.10b shows the final reduced spectrum, with absorbance peaks at 418, 522, 548, 554 and 607 nm, and a shoulder at 460 nm. The spectrum was similar to that of holocytochrome cd\\(_1\\) from T. pantotropha but not identical; this point is discussed further in the following section. Changes in the spectrum between the as-isolated and dithionite reduced forms are illustrated by a difference spectrum, shown in Figure 5.11a. Figure 5.11: Difference spectra of (a) dithionite-reduced minus as-isolated spectra from peak 3 and (b) dithionite-reduced peak 3 minus peak 2. The absolute difference spectra shown in figures 5.9 and 5.10 were subtracted from one another to highlight differences between the reduced and oxidised holo cytochrome (a) and the holo- and semi-apo cytochromes (b). In both cases, difference absorbance maxima appear at 423, 522, 548 and 610 nm. In addition, spectrum (a) shows a peak at 460 nm, which is a pronounced shoulder in spectrum (b). Major changes in absorbance were noted at 423, 460, 522, 554 and 608 nm. A second difference spectrum of dithionite-reduced peak 3 minus peak 2 is shown in Figure 5.11b. Similar changes were noted, at 423, 522, 548 and 610 nm. The concentrated material from peaks 2 and 3 was assayed for oxidase activity using horse heart cytochrome c as an electron donor, and for nitrite reductase activity using reduced methyl viologen. Assay traces from these experiments are shown in Figure 5.12. Figure 5.12: (a) Cytochrome c oxidase and (b) nitrite reductase activities of the concentrated fractions from peak 3 following ion exchange chromatography. Samples from peak 3 were assayed for oxidase activity using reduced horse heart cytochrome c as electron donor, and for nitrite reductase activity using reduced methyl viologen as electron donor, as described in Materials and Methods. Beneath each trace are estimates of the activity expressed as nmol of electron donor oxidised per minute per mg of protein, which are the means of three separate assays. Peak 2 had no activity as either an oxidase or a nitrite reductase. Peak 3 showed a very low oxidase activity of 4.32 +/- 0.6 nmol cytochrome c oxidised per minute per mg of protein. The nitrite reductase activity was higher but was more variable; approximately 290 +/- 90 nmol of methyl viologen was oxidised per minute per mg of protein. Attempts to relate these figures to the turnover number of purified cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) are discussed in the following section. 5.3 Discussion Ps aeruginosa PAO1 was chosen as a suitable candidate for expression studies based on the criteria outlined in Section 5.1, one of which was its genetic amenability. It was one of the organisms tested in the original construction of plasmid pMMB67EH (Furste et al., 1986)271 and the early experiments in this chapter showed that transformation and plasmid purification from the strain are quite straightforward (Figure 5.1). Having successfully introduced the plasmid into Ps. aeruginosa PAO1, the next objective was to investigate the growth of the transformed cells. Aerobically, the growth of all cultures was similar, regardless of the presence of nitrate or induction by IPTG (Figure 5.2). This was similar to the result obtained using E. coli JM83 in Chapter 4. However, anaerobically there was a pronounced growth defect in cells carrying pMMBSE regardless of whether IPTG was present. These cultures reached a maximum absorbance at 650 nm of only around 0.6-0.8 compared to around 1.6 in the wild type cultures and entered stationary phase earlier. The cell pellets from anaerobic cultures containing pMMBSE were also much paler when harvested. In E. coli there was some suggestion of an anaerobic growth defect but it was not clear how marked this was, because the combined stress of countering the antibiotic and growing in the minimal medium affected growth regardless of the presence of the nirS gene on the plasmid. The growth of cultures of Ps. aeruginosa containing only pMMB67EH was not tested but even so, the anaerobic growth defect in cultures containing pMMBSE is clearly much more pronounced. The concentration of nitrite in the culture medium under anaerobic condition was measured, to assess whether a build up of toxic nitrite was responsible for the poor growth of cells containing plasmid pMMBSE. Figure 5.3 shows that in both induced and non-induced cultures of Ps. aeruginosa [pMMBSE], nitrite accumulates to a similar maximum level as seen in the wild-type, but then remains at this concentration, rather than rapidly disappearing from the medium. This indicates that for some reason, nitrite reduction is compromised in cells containing pMMBSE. The haem stained gel of extracts from each culture under different growth conditions (Figure 5.6) shows that levels of the endogenous cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) are substantially attenuated in cells containing pMMBSE. It appears that for some reason the presence of the pMMBSE plasmid under anaerobic conditions leads to attenuated expression of the endogenous cytochrome cd\\(1\\). This in turn prevents the removal of nitrite produced from the nitrate reductase activity of the cells and eventually leads to the premature cessation of growth. The observation also suggests that any activity of the expressed T. pantotropha nirS gene product is not sufficient to lower the nitrite concentration. As this effect occurs only in cells containing pMMBSE under anaerobic conditions regardless of induction, it is inferred that the effect is linked to a factor on the plasmid which is only active anaerobically. One possible candidate might be the NNR binding site which is present on pMMBSE. Ps. aeruginosa contains at least two proteins of the FNR family, named ANR (Sawers, 1991)297 and DNR (Arai et al., 1995).197 The second of these is in the same phylogenetic group as the NNR protein (de Boer, 1996)168 and could conceivably interact with the NNR binding site, to which it would not normally be exposed. This might reduce levels of the protein and lead to the down-regulation of the endogenous nitrite reductase. However, there are arguments against this interpretation. First, the plasmid pMMBSE is quite low in copy number; the exact number of copies per cell is not known, but is likely to be in the order of 12 copies (Frey et al., 1992),298 as the plasmid is based on the RSF1010 replicon. If the DNR (or ANR) molecule is expressed in a similar way to the FNR protein in E. coli, it could be present at around 2 400 copies per cell (Unden and Duchêne, 1987)299 and so would be unlikely to be titrated out by the plasmid. A fall in free concentration of DNR/ANR under anaerobic conditions might also be expected to be compensated for by autoregulation, which is seen in the case of the FNR gene (Spiro and Guest, 1987).181 However these arguments are based on analogy to FNR and as we know little of how DNR/ANR works there may still be a case for interaction between this molecule and the NNR binding site on pMMBSE, which is not understood at present. The only other relevant portion of the pMMBSE plasmid is the truncated nirE gene, the first 648 bp of which are present in this construct. This encodes 216 out of a total 287 amino acids and it may be that the truncated protein is expressed under anaerobic growth, so interfering with the normal regulation of denitrification in Ps. aeruginosa and leading to the effects detailed above. Possible effects of the plasmid-borne NNR binding site and the nirE gene could be clarified by control experiments, examining the growth of cultures containing plasmid pMMB67EH, plasmids that carried only the NNR binding site or only the nirS structural gene. The nature of the anaerobic growth defect is, therefore, quite complex and not understood at present, though its main practical consequence is a reduced cell yield, to be taken into account when considering the amount of recombinant cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) that might be obtained. Expression of the nirS gene from pMMBSE in Ps. aeruginosa is similar to that seen in E. coli JM83, in that expression only occurs following induction with IPTG, when cells are grown either aerobically or anaerobically. This indicates that the T. pantotropha nirS promoter is non-functional in Ps. aeruginosa. Both T. pantotropha (Steinrücke and Ludwig, 1993)257 and Ps. aeruginosa (West and Ingewski, 1988)300 have a higher genomic G+C content than E. coli, but apparently there is no precedent for a GC-based promoter structure based solely upon a higher G+C genomic content. These results also demonstrate that the tac promoter and the lacI\\(^q\\) gene are functional in Ps. aeruginosa, a result consistent with previous studies (Fujita and Anemura, 1992,301 Brunschwig and Darzins, 1992).302 The expressed cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) is the same size as the native T. pantotropha protein and has c-type haem attached, indicating that as in E. coli, translocation to the periplasm and subsequent processing have occurred normally. When expressed anaerobically a smeared band of high molecular weight was observed by Western blotting, in addition to the cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) band (Figure 5.5). This appears to be aggregated cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) rather than a different cross reacting protein; the anti-cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) antibody is very specific, as shown by its lack of reactivity towards the cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) of Ps. aeruginosa (and also Ps. stutzeri, not shown). This observation is in agreement with previous immunological studies, in which an antibody to cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) from Ps. stutzeri ATCC 14405 was found to be almost strain specific, reacting only weakly with the protein from only a very few other strains of Ps. stutzeri (Ward et al., 1993).303 The aggregated material may originate in vivo or during sample boiling prior to SDS-PAGE, but the former explanation appears more likely as this phenomenon was specific to extracts from anaerobically-grown induced cultures. The protein seems to be expressed at a higher level in Ps. aeruginosa compared to E. coli under these conditions and this may contribute to the aggregation problem; aggregation of over-expressed proteins, including those found in the periplasm has been described previously e.g. for T-cell receptor protein (Wulfing and Pluckthun, 1994),304 insulin-like growth factor-1 (Wong et al., 1988)305 and anti-influenza neuraminidase antibody NC41 (Kortt et al., 1995).306 Attempts to partially purify recombinant cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) from Ps. aeruginosa PAO1 proved to be quite challenging. To begin with the cells cannot be spheroplasted in the normal way to release the periplasm, as they are prone to lysis in the presence of EDTA. Other attempts at spheroplasting that omitted EDTA or used a washing step with 0.2 M MgCl\\(_2\\) (Cheng et al., 1970)307 yielded an extract with an extremely pale colour and so it was decided to begin the purification with a total soluble extract from sonicated cells. However, extract from anaerobically grown cells could not be eluted cleanly from a small DEAE Sepharose ion exchange column. The flow rate under these circumstances was very uneven and a resolved elution profile was not obtainable. This occurred several times, even after extensive ultracentrifugation of the extract. It was assumed initially that the aggregated material seen by Western blotting might be causing a blockage in the column, leading to the uneven elution observed. Other possible causes include the presence of polysaccharide or nucleic acids in the sample. The use of a small column (1 x 10 cm) may have contributed to the poor resolution, due to disturbances in the flow caused by surface-tension effects across the narrow column diameter. However, this did not seem to be a major problem during purification of soluble extract from E. coli JM83 (see Figure 4.12, Chapter 4), or during other purifications. To alleviate the possible effects of all the factors outlined above, a number of changes were made to the procedure. First, Ps. aeruginosa PAO1 [pMMBSE] was grown and induced aerobically in the presence of 50 mM potassium nitrate. The rationale for this approach was that the protein is expressed aerobically following induction as shown by Western blotting but the aggregated material is not observed and, additionally, it is been shown that the presence of nitrate under aerobic conditions in Ps. aeruginosa is sufficient to promote the synthesis of active holocytochrome cd\\(_1\\) (and therefore d\\(_1\\) haem, Zennaro et al., 1993).215 Cultures of 1 l volume were grown in 5 l flasks at a low shaking rate in the hope that this would lower the oxygen tension to some degree, increasing the expression of nitrite reductase but preventing aggregation. Additionally, the cells were lysed by a lysozyme freeze-thaw treatment to reduce polysaccharides and after centrifugation, the viscous supernatant was treated with DNase and filtered. Finally the column diameter was increased to 2 cm and the gradient was run against gravity to improve resolution (Scopes, 1987).234 The orange-brown soluble extract obtained was bound to the column, washed and eluted and this time an even flow rate was observed with a clean, well-resolved elution profile exhibiting three peaks (Figure 5.7). Haem-staining of the fractions from the top of each peak showed that peaks 2 and 3 contained a c-type cytochrome with the same mobility as the native cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) from T. pantotropha (Figure 5.11). This is what would be expected were the cytochromes to be semi-apo (peak 2) and holo- (peak 3) cytochrome cd\\(_1\\); the latter protein elutes at around 250 mM NaCl, with the semi-apo protein eluting slightly earlier on anion exchange columns. A haem-stained sample of total extract from this culture (lane 1) shows clearly that the cytochromes from peaks 2 and 3 correspond to the band that appears in this culture on induction with IPTG, which is slightly higher than the endogenous cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) band. It was therefore clear that both peaks, 2 and 3, contained recombinant T. pantotropha cytochrome cd\\(_1\\). Spectroscopy was used to characterise further the proteins from each of the three peaks. Peak 1 exhibited a broad peak at 405 nm as isolated, and two peaks at 425 and 557 nm in the dithionite-reduced form. These features indicate a haem-containing protein, possibly a b- or c-type cytochrome. The sample was not investigated further. Peak 2 exhibited absorbance maxima that identified it as being semi-apo cytochrome cd\\(_1\\). The spectrum was virtually identical to that of the recombinant semi-apo cytochrome cd isolated from E. coli JM83 (Chapter 4) and to that of the chemically-prepared semi-apo protein in the reduced state. Peak 3 had a stronger A\\(_{410}\\) absorbance than peak 2. The spectrum of the pooled fractions from the peak (Figure 5.9a) exhibited peak absorbances at 409, 523, 547 and 628 nm. Overall, the spectrum resembled cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) in the oxidised state, but the slight (red-shift) of the c-haem \\(\\beta\\) and \\(\\gamma\\) bands and the small absorbance at 547 nm indicated that a small proportion of the enzyme was reduced. Absorbance in the 600-700 nm region was small but significant, indicating the presence of d\\(_1\\) haem. Several small additions of sodium dithionite resulted in a gradual reduction of the protein and the final recorded spectrum is shown in Figure 5.9b. This spectrum had peak absorbances at 418, 522, 548, 554 and 607 nm. There was a pronounced shoulder at 460 nm and the absorbance peak of 607 nm was quite broad, spreading across the 600-650 nm region. These features are again quite similar to the cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) holoprotein in the reduced form, but there are some significant differences; in Figure 5.9b the absorbance at 460 nm is attenuated compared to the native protein. Also, the absorbance in the 600-650 nm region is different, with the peak absorbance significantly blue-shifted and comprising a single broad absorbance. However, difference spectra of the reduced minus as-isolated material from peak 3 (Figure 5.10a) and of the reduced peak 3 minus peak 2 (Figure 5.10b) indicate that the changes in the reduced spectrum of material from peak 3 have occurred in regions where d\\(_1\\) haem absorbs, at 460 nm and in the 600-650 nm region. Table 5.2 shows the ratios of some of the peak absorbances in the spectra of the semiapo- and putative holocytochrome cd\\(_1\\) expressed in Ps. aeruginosa, compared with the native protein from T. pantotropha. Table 5.2: Comparison of the ratios of the absorbance maxima in the reduced state of native holo- and chemically-prepared semi-apo cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) from T. pantotropha with those of the partially purified recombinant protein from Ps. aeruginosa or E. coli. Absorbance maxima of the recombinant proteins and of the chemically-prepared semiapo protein were recorded directly from spectroscopic measurements. The ratios for the purified holoprotein from T. pantotropha were calculated from extinction coefficients supplied by Alrik Koppenhöfer. Chemically-prepared semi-apo cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) was reduced using sodium dithionite, whereas the recombinant semi-apoproteins were isolated in the reduced state and were not further reduced by the addition of sodium dithionite. The symbol (-) indicates that the ratio is not relevant for the particular case. Absorbance ratio T. pantotropha holoprotein, reduced Ps. aeruginosa recombinant holoprotein, reduced T. pantotropha chemically-prepared semi-apoprotein, reduced Ps. aeruginosa recombinant semi-apoprotein, reduced E. coli recombinant semi-apoprotein, reduced 418:522 7.48 2.92 2.72 6.16 5.73 418:548 6.60 2.88 2.69 6.59 5.72 418:554 6.68 2.90 2.67 6.50 5.62 418:650 8.06 522:548 0.88 0.99 0.99 1.07 1.00 522:554 0.89 0.99 0.98 1.06 0.98 522:650 1.08 548:554 1.01 1.01 0.99 0.99 0.98 548:650 1.22 554:650 1.21 418:607 3.87 522:607 1.32 548:607 1.34 554:607 1.34 These data indicate that the c haem:d\\(_1\\) haem ratio is somewhat lower in the expressed material. One explanation for this is that the material is not spectroscopically pure and may be contaminated with some semi-apo protein because of incomplete resolution of peaks 2 and 3. However, the peaks appear quite well separated in the elution profile (Figure 5.7) and spectroscopic analysis of the later fractions from peak 3 before concentration gave similar results to those obtained after concentration (not shown). A second explanation is that d\\(_1\\) haem incorporation differs somewhat in the expressed protein and this is supported to some extent by analysis of the activity of the expressed protein. As expected, peak 2, the recombinant semi-apo cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) shows neither oxidase or nitrite reductase activity, in the absence of the d\\(_1\\) haem. However, the recombinant holocytochrome cd\\(_1\\) has an oxidase activity of around 4.3 nmol cytochrome c oxidised per minute per mg of protein. Using the extinction coefficient determined for native cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) at 548 nm, this converts to a turnover number of approximately 0.64 min\\(^{-1}\\). Purified native cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) from T. pantotropha assayed under the same conditions gave a turnover number of approximately 3 min\\(^{-1}\\). In contrast, the nitrite reductase activity seemed less affected in the expressed protein; although these assays were more variable, a turnover number of around 60 min\\(^{-1}\\) was calculated for the expressed protein, compared to about 124 min\\(^{-1}\\) for the native protein. However, it may not be appropriate to use the extinction coefficients determined for the native protein in these circumstances, due to the spectroscopic changes observed in the recombinant material and indeed, using different peak absorbances for these calculations gives different estimates of cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) concentration. An approximate idea of cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) concentration might be obtained from measuring the protein concentration of a pure sample, though in this case not enough material was obtained for further purification. The most reasonable summary of these results is that the recombinant protein has both oxidase and nitrite reductase activities, which appear to be somewhat lower than those of the native protein, while spectroscopic features that indicate the presence of d\\(_1\\) haem but suggest that it is not bound in an identical fashion to that seen in the native protein. Inefficient d\\(_1\\) haem incorporation may also explain why some of the recombinant material was expressed as the semi-apo protein, though it may also be that under the semi-aerobic growth conditions, insufficient d\\(_1\\) haem was produced to complex with all of the expressed polypeptide. The observed differences between the expressed and native holocytochromes cd\\(_1\\) may result from improper interactions between the expressed polypeptide and the biosynthetic apparatus for cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) in Ps. aeruginosa. Although several homologous genes involved in cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) biosynthesis have been identified in Ps. aeruginosa, Ps. stutzeri and P. denitrificans, the specific genes found in each organism and their physicaland arrangement differs (Zumft and Körner, 1997)167 and it is likely that each system is adapted to its own specific cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) polypeptide to some degree. Another possibility is that under semi-aerobic conditions a proportion of the haem inserted in to the expressed protein is not of the d\\(_1\\) type, but some other haem. Ps. aeruginosa synthesises a number of haem molecules including haems o (Matsushita et al., 1980),308 a\\(_3\\) and a, (Fujiwara et al., 1992),309 the latter of which was shown to insert into semi-apo cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) in vitro and result in a low oxidase activity (Hill and Wharton, 1978).118 Alternative haems might be identifiable by organic extraction and spectroscopy of the haem group; this was attempted on a small amount of the expressed protein but was inconclusive, again due to the small amounts of material obtained. However, it seems more likely that the protein contains d\\(_1\\) haem that is bound differently from the native protein, as the observed absorbances were in the correct positions for haem d\\(_1\\), if not identical to the native protein, and the colours of the expressed and native proteins were similar. Notably, incomplete reconstitution of the recombinant semi-apo protein from E. coli produces cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) in which the d\\(_1\\) haem absorbance features observed in the present chapter (a broad absorbance at 600-650 nm with a blue shifted peak and an attenuated 460 nm peak) are also observed. The experiments described in this chapter suggest that Ps. aeruginosa is of some use as a heterologous host for expression of cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) from T. pantotropha, but there are disadvantages. The recombinant protein had some activity, which indicates that the system could be used to determine whether mutants of cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) possessed activity when compared with the native protein. However, the apparent differences in the spectrum of the expressed protein and in its activity, as compared with the native protein, warrant further investigation. Additionally, the comments from Chapter 4 pertaining to methods of improving the levels of expression apply here, as it would be advantageous to obtain more material for further purification and subsequent analysis. These experiments show that the method of using a denitrifying heterologous host for expression is a valid one, and it may also be possible to try expression in other hosts, such as Ps. stutzeri or A. eutrophus. The latter approach may also be advantageous as Ps. aeruginosa is an opportunistically pathogenic organism that requires some care in handling and, as a further practical consideration, requires the use of high concentrations of carbenicillin, an expensive antibiotic, to maintain the plasmid pMMBSE.

In each of these cases holo cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) could be obtained, either by reconstitution in vitro with haem d\\(_1\\) in the former case or by expression under denitrifying conditions in the latter. It was seen that neither of these approaches were ideal in terms of both the uniformity of the material obtained and the difficulties in comparing the expressed material to the wild-type protein. The experiments in this chapter therefore focus on a third possible expression system, utilising a mutant of T. pantotropha in which part of the nirS gene has been deleted. Such mutants would not synthesise cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) nitrite reductase and would not be expected to grow well under anaerobic conditions, using nitrate as a terminal electron acceptor, because the nitrite that would accumulate in the absence of cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) is toxic. In theory it should be possible to complement the mutants using the nirS gene on a plasmid and restore growth on nitrate. However, there are three possible problems to consider using this approach: first, over-expression of the plasmid-borne nirS gene may interfere with the normal regulation of denitrification in the cell (for instance by out-stripping the supply of haem d\\(_1\\) to the polypeptide), second, disruption of the nirS gene may adversely affect d\\(_1\\) haem biosynthesis and third, expression of inactive mutants of cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) will not restore growth on nitrate to the cells which will die because of the build-up of nitrite. The experiments described in this chapter fall into three sections. In the first part the construction of two mutagenic plasmids is described; these are used to insert a kanamycin marker cassette upstream of the nirS gene and then to construct the unmarked deletion in the gene itself. The second part of the chapter concentrates on the analysis of this mutant and its complementation using the cloned nirS gene. Finally, in part three, attempts to express the first site-directed mutant of cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) in which Tyr-25 is replaced with phenylalanine are described. 6.2 Results 6.2.1 Construction of mutagenic plasmids and of the unmarked deletion mutant in the nirS gene The methods used to construct an unmarked deletion in the nirS gene of T. pantotropha were developed by van Spanning (1991).310 To create the deletion two mutagenesis steps were used. First, a kanamycin resistance marker was inserted upstream of the nirS gene cloned in the suicide plasmid pGRPd1. The plasmid was then mobilised into T. pantotropha and cells in which the marker had inserted into the chromosome by homologous recombination were selected. This procedure is outlined in Figure 6.1. Figure 6.1: Construction of a kanamycin insertional mutant in the nir region of the T. pantotropha genome. (a) Plasmid pGRPN3K (Table 6.1) is introduced into the cell and undergoes a single homologous recombination with the nir region of the chromosome. (b) This results in a plasmid integrant strain which is both kanamycin- and spectinomycin resistant due to the spectinomycin resistance gene on the vector. (c) A second homologous recombination results in integration of the kan gene upstream of the nirS gene and loss of the spectinomycin resistance determinant on the suicide plasmid. Enzymes: P, PstI, Sp, SphI. In the second step, a copy of the nirS gene from which a fragment had been deleted was cloned into a second suicide plasmid, pRVS1. This construct was then mobilised into the strain of T. pantotropha carrying the kanamycin marker and cells in which the marker and the wild-type nirS gene were replaced by the copy carrying the deletion were selected. This step is outlined in Figure 6.2. Figure 6.2: Construction of a nirS deletion mutant strain in T. pantotropha. (a) Plasmid pRVS\\(\\Delta\\)nir (Table 6.1) is introduced into the cell and undergoes a single homologous recombination with the nir region of the chromosome. (b) This results in a plasmid integrant strain which is kanamycin- and spectinomycin resistant and colours blue on XGal plates due to the lacZ gene on the vector. (c) A second homologous recombination removes the kan gene from the chromosome and inserts the cloned nirS gene which contains the deletion. The lacZ and spectinomycin resistance genes are lost on the suicide plasmid. Enzymes: (B), (E) 382 bp BamHI - EcoRI fragment removed, ends blunted and religated. N, NotI.

Figure 6.3: Construction of the suicide plasmid pGRPN3K. Full details of plasmids are given in Table 6.1. Only the relevant restriction fragments are shown. Plasmid pGRPN3K was used to construct the kanamycin insertion mutant T. pantotropha K7. Enzymes: B, BamHI, E, EcoRI, H, HindIII, N, NotI, P, PstI, S, SalI, Sp, SphI. To create this plasmid, a 1.2 kbp PstI fragment containing the kanamycin resistance gene (kan) from the plasmid pUC4K (Vieira and Messing, 1982)313 was isolated and ligated into the PstI site of the plasmid pTNIR3. The latter site was located 27 bp upstream of the nirS NNR box. The new plasmid, designated pTNIR3K, was digested with SphI to generate an 8.3 kbp fragment containing the kan gene and having 5’- and 3’-ends in the norB and nirE genes respectively, as was described in Chapter 4 (Figure 4.2). The SphI fragment was ligated into the SphI site of the suicide plasmid pGRPd1, to give the final construct for use in insertional mutagenesis which was designated pGRPN3K. The plasmid was analysed by restriction digestion to confirm that it was the desired construct (Figure 6.4). Figure 6.4: Restriction digest analysis of plasmid pGRPN3K. Following ligation and transformation, plasmid DNA was isolated from the transformed cells and digested using EcoRI (lanes 1-6), the DNA fragments were separated by electrophoresis on a 0.8% agarose gel. The possible orientations of the SphI insert from pTNIR3K are shown below the gel. Two EcoRI sites in the insert and a third site in the vector produce three fragments of approximate sizes 6.3, 5.6 and 3.6 kbp (first orientation) or 7.0, 5.6 and 2.9 Kbp (second orientation). These are seen in lanes 1 and 5 respectively. Enzymes: E, EcoRI, Sp, SphI. Lanes labelled III and II contain DNA size standards, the sizes of some of which are indicated to the left of the gel. T. pantotropha was transformed with pGRPN3K by conjugal transfer of the plasmid from E. coli S17-1. The mated cells were harvested, serially diluted and plated on minimal acetate medium containing 100 \\(\\mu\\)g ml\\(^{-1}\\) kanamycin and 1 mM PbNO\\(_3\\) to select for T. pantotropha that had taken up the plasmid. 50 transconjugant colonies were picked from these plates and streaked onto fresh minimal acetate medium containing 100 \\(\\mu\\)g ml\\(^{-1}\\) kanamycin and onto identical plates that contained additionally 100 \\(\\mu\\)g ml\\(^{-1}\\) spectinomycin. The selection step distinguished vector integrant strains arising from a single crossover (phenotype Km\\(^r\\)Sp\\(^r\\)) from the desired insertion mutant strains which arose from a double crossover (phenotype Km\\(^r\\)Sp\\(^s\\)). Fifteen of the latter type were identified, although each streak was still contaminated to some degree with E. coli S17-1. To remove the contaminants one of the streaks was picked with a sterile loop, diluted in LB medium and lated on LB medium containing 100 \\(\\mu\\)g ml\\(^{-1}\\) kanamycin and 1 mM PbNO\\(_3\\). Four single colonies were obtained from this plate and designated T. pantotropha K7-K10. The colonies were confirmed as having the required Km\\(^r\\)Sp\\(^s\\) phenotype. To confirm correct insertion of the kanamycin resistance marker into the chromosome, genomic DNA was isolated from T. pantotropha K7, digested with HindIII and probed by Southern blotting using the 1.2 kbp fragment of pUC4K labelled with digoxigenin. Fragments of the expected sizes (4.8 and 1.1 kbp) were observed on the blot (Figure 6.5), confirming that the kan gene had inserted only once in the expected site. Figure 6.5: Southern blot of genomic DNA from T. pantotropha K7 using the kanamycin resistance gene as a probe. Genomic DNA from wild-type T. pantotropha, T. pantotropha K7 and T. pantotropha \\(\\Delta7\\) was digested using HindIII and probed with the 1.2 kbp PstI fragment of pUC4K, labelled with digoxigenin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate. The two fragments of molecular weights 4.8 and 1.1 kbp in lane 2 arise from the insertion of the kan gene upstream of the nirS gene (Figure 6.3). Lanes: 1, T. pantotropha wild-type, 2, T. pantotropha K7,3, T. pantotropha \\(\\Delta7\\), 4, T. pantotropha \\(\\Delta8\\). Construction of the suicide plasmid containing a deletion in the nirS gene is outlined in Figure 6.6. Figure 6.6: Construction of the suicide plasmid pRVS\\(\\Delta\\)nir. Only the relevant restriction fragments are shown. Full details of the plasmids are given in Table 6.1. Plasmid pRVS\\(\\Delta\\)nir was used to construct the nirS deletion mutants \\(\\Delta5\\), \\(\\Delta7\\), \\(\\Delta8\\). Enzymes: B, BamHI, E, EcoRI, H, HindIII, N, NotI, S, SalI. A 4.2 kbp NotI fragment containing the nirS gene and approximately 1.9 kbp and 0.5 kbp of upstream and downstream DNA respectively was isolated from the plasmid pTNIR3 and ligated into the NotI site of the plasmid pGEM5zf(+), giving a plasmid which was designated pLN3N. pLN3N was digested using BamHI and EcoRI to remove an internal fragment of 382 bp from the nirS gene. The fragment corresponded to amino acids 9 to 136 in the mature cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) polypeptide and included the haem ligands His-17 and Tyr-25. The DNA fragment from which the 382 bp fragment had been removed was isolated, the ends were blunted using T4 DNA polymerase and the plasmid was religated. The absence of the 382 bp fragment was demonstrated with digests using the enzymes PstI, NotI and SalI (Figure 6.7). Figure 6.7: Restriction digest analysis of plasmids pLN3N and PLN3N\\(\\Delta\\)nir. Following ligation and transformation, plasmid DNA was isolated from the transformed cells and digested using PstI plus NotI (lanes 1 and 2) or SalI (lanes 3 and 4). The digested DNA was separated by electrophoresis on a 0.8% agarose gel. Lanes 1 and 3 contain DNA from pLN3N, lanes 2 and 4 contain DNA from pLN3N\\(\\Delta\\)nir. In lane 1, three fragments of approximate sizes 3, 2.4 and 1.8 kbp are seen. The two smaller fragments correspond to the NotI insert from pLN3N. In lane 2 the 2.4 kbp fragment has moved to 2 kbp, due to the removal of the 382 bp BamHI - EcoRI fragment. Lane 3 shows two SalI fragments from pLN3N. In lane 4 the internal SalI site in the 382 bp BamHI - EcoRI fragment has been lost, giving a linearised plasmid of approximate size 6.9 kbp. Enzymes: B, BamHI, E, EcoRI, H, HindIII, N, NotI, P, I, S, SalI. Lanes labelled III and II contain DNA size standards, some of which are indicated at the left of the gel. These digests showed clearly that the plasmid had lost 382 bp and that a SalI site which lay between the BamHI and EcoRI sites was not present. The new plasmid with the 382 bp deletion was named pLN3N\\(\\Delta\\)nir. The NotI fragment of pLN3N\\(\\Delta\\)nir, now 3.8 kbp long, was isolated, the ends were blunted using Sequenase (T7 DNA polymerase) and the fragment was ligated into the SmaI site of the suicide vector pRVS1 to give the final construct for mutagenesis, designated pRVS\\(\\Delta\\)nir. The presence of the insert was confirmed by digestion with EcoRI, StyI and SalI (Figure 6.8) and by a PCR reaction using pRVS\\(\\Delta\\)nir as template DNA and the primers nirSF and MIDR (Table 3.1, Chapter 3). Figure 6.8: Restriction digest analysis of plasmids pRVS1 and pRVS\\(\\Delta\\)nir. Following ligation and transformation, plasmid DNA was isolated from transformed E. coli and digested using EcoRI (lanes 1 and 2), NruI (lanes 3 and 4), SalI (lanes 5 and 6) and StyI (lanes 7 and 8). The digested DNA was then separated by electrophoresis on a 0.8% agarose gel. Lanes 1, 3, 5 and 7 contain DNA from plasmid pRVS1, lanes 2, 4, 6 and 8 contain DNA from plasmid pRVS\\(\\Delta\\)nir. As described in the text, restriction analysis of these plasmids was difficult to interpret due to the lack of a restriction map for pRVS1. However, the digests in lanes 1-2 and 5-6 clearly show that pRVS\\(\\Delta\\)nir contains an insert of around 3.8 kbp, the expected size of the insert. The digests in lanes 3-4 and 7-8 show extra NruI and StyI sites in pRVS\\(\\Delta\\)nir which can be related to the known sequence of the nirS gene and to restriction analysis of plasmids containing the nir region (Chapter 4). The lane labelled II contains DNA size standards, the sizes of some of which are indicated at the left of the gel. This primer pair gave a 903 bp PCR product from the complete nirS gene, but as the 382 bp deletion lies between the primers the expected size of the PCR fragment should have been shortened to 521 bp. The smaller product was clearly seen using pRVS\\(\\Delta\\)nir as the template DNA (Figure 6.9). Figure 6.9: PCR analysis of plasmid pRVS\\(\\Delta\\)nir showing a 382 bp deletion in the cloned nirS gene. Plasmid pRVS\\(\\Delta\\)nir was used as the template in a PCR reaction with the primers nirSF (forward) and MIDR (reverse) described in Chapter 3, Table 3.1. The primer pair flanks the site of the deletion in the nirS gene, generating a PCR product of 903 bp in the wild-type gene (Chapter 3, Figure 3.1). The 382 bp deletion in this region generates a PCR product of 521 bp, which can be seen in lane 1. The lane labelled M contains a 100 bp DNA size standard ladder with some of the fragment sizes indicated at the left of the gel. T. pantotropha K7 was transformed with pRVS\\(\\Delta\\)nir by conjugal transfer from E. coli S17-1 and transconjugants were selected initially on LB medium containing 100 \\(\\mu\\)g ml\\(^{-1}\\) kanamycin, 100 \\(\\mu\\)g ml\\(^{-1}\\) spectinomycin and 40 \\(\\mu\\)g ml\\(^{-1}\\) X-Gal. These conditions selected for vector integrant strains formed by a single crossover, the lacZ gene on the integrated plasmid causing the colonies to be coloured pale blue. To promote the required double crossover event, in which the vector together with the kanamycin resistance gene were excised and the deletion was inserted into the chromosomal nirS gene, a single blue colony was inoculated into 1.5 ml of LB medium that contained no antibiotics and grown aerobically overnight. This culture was inoculated into fresh LB medium and grown again. The culture was then serially diluted and plated on LB medium containing X-Gal at a concentration of 80 \\(\\mu\\)g ml\\(^{-1}\\). Most of the colonies obtained were vector integrants which formed small dark-blue colonies on these plates. However, 25 white colonies were obtained and these were streaked onto either LB medium, LB medium plus 100 \\(\\mu\\)g ml\\(^{-1}\\) kanamycin or LB medium plus 100 \\(\\mu\\)g ml\\(^{-1}\\) spectinomycin. Of these, three exhibited the required white, Km\\(^s\\)Sp\\(^s\\) phenotype; they were stocked and designated T. pantotropha \\(\\Delta5\\), \\(\\Delta7\\) and \\(\\Delta8\\). To confirm that the deletion in the chromosomal nirS gene was correct, genomic DNA was prepared from wild-type T. pantotropha, T. pantotropha K7 and the three deletion mutants, digested using StyI and probed by Southern blotting using a 141 bp fragment of the nirS gene that had been labelled with digoxigenin by PCR. The Southern blot (Figure 6.10) showed all of the expected hybridising fragments, confirming that the deletion mutants were the desired ones. Figure 6.10: Southern blot of genomic DNA from wild-type T. pantotropha, T. pantotropha K7 and the nirS deletion mutants \\(\\Delta5\\), \\(\\Delta7\\) and \\(\\Delta8\\) using a nirS-derived probe. Genomic DNA was digested using StyI and probed using a 141 bp PCR product derived from the nirS gene using the primers nirSF and 228R (Table 3.1, Chapter 3), labelled with digoxigenin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate. The map below the blot indicates the StyI sites in the 4.2 kbp NotI fragment in which the deletion was made to give pRVS\\(\\Delta\\)nir. All of the expected fragments are visible on the blot except for the 2.1 kbp fragment in the insertion mutant strain; the larger size of this fragment and the small degree of overlap of the probe resulted in a very weak hybridisation that was barely visible on the original blot and cannot be seen on the photograph. The position of the 2.1 kbp fragment is indicated at the right of the gel, along with the other fragments. Lanes: 1, T. pantotropha wild-type, 2, T. pantotropha K7, 3-5, T. pantotropha \\(\\Delta5\\), \\(\\Delta7\\) and \\(\\Delta8\\). Enzymes: S, StyI, P, PstI, B, BamHI, E, EcoRI 6.2.2 Analysis of the nirS insertion and deletion mutants The kanamycin insertion mutant, unmarked deletion mutant and wild-type strains of T. pantotropha were compared first by growing each strain anaerobically in minimal succinate medium plus 50 mM KNO\\(_3\\) (Figure 6.11). Figure 6.11: Comparison of the anaerobic growth of T. pantotropha with that of T. pantotropha K7 and T. pantotropha \\(\\Delta7\\). Overnight cultures of each strain were inoculated at a dilution of 1/100 into minimal succinate medium plus 20 mM nitrate and growth was monitored by the increased absorbance at 650 nm (logarithmic scale). Symbols: (◆) T. pantotropha, (■) T. pantotropha K7, (▲) T. pantotropha \\(\\Delta7\\). The other deletion mutant strains (\\(\\Delta5\\) and \\(\\Delta8\\)) grew identically to \\(\\Delta7\\). T. pantotropha wild-type and strain K7 grew at similar rates and reached a similar final optical density of around 1.3 at 650 nm. However, the three nirS deletion mutants grew poorly; each one entered stationary phase earlier than the wild-type or kanamycin insertion strains and reached a final A\\(_{650}\\) of only around 0.52. In the unmarked deletion mutants cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) should be absent, leading to a build up of toxic nitrite due to nitrate reductase activity. To confirm this, 1 ml samples were taken from each of the three cultures, harvested and assayed colorimetrically for nitrite (Figure 6.12). Figure 6.12: Comparison of (a) the anaerobic growth and (b) nitrite accumulation of T. pantotropha with that of T. pantotropha K7 and T. pantotropha \\(\\Delta7\\). Overnight cultures of each strain were inoculated at a dilution of 1/100 into minimal succinate medium plus 20 mM nitrate and growth was monitored by the increase in absorbance at 650 nm (logarithmic scale). 1 ml samples of culture were removed at each time point, centrifuged and the supernatant was assayed colorimetrically for nitrite. Symbols: (◆) T. pantotropha, (■) T. pantotropha K7, (▲) T. pantotropha \\(\\Delta7\\). Culture medium that contained wild-type T. pantotropha showed a steady rise in nitrite concentration to a maximum of about 3 mM near the end of the exponential growth phase, followed by a rapid decline to undetectable levels in under two hours. A similar process was observed for T. pantotropha K7, although the maximum concentration of nitrite reached was higher at 13 mM. In the unmarked deletion mutant nitrite concentration continued to rise as growth slowed and reached a maximum of almost 20 mM, indicating that almost all the nitrate originally present was converted to nitrite. The cells stopped growing at about the time that maximum nitrite concentration was reached. After growth, each of the cultures was harvested and a total soluble extract was prepared by sonication and ultracentrifugation. The colour of the cell pellets from each culture differed; the wild-type cells were brown when harvested, whereas cells of T. pantotropha K7 were pink and cells from the deletion mutants were off-white. 40 \\(\\mu\\)g of protein from each extract was separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose and probed by Western blotting using mouse antibody to P. denitrificans cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) (Figure 6.13). Figure 6.13: Western blot of total soluble extracts from wild-type T. pantotropha, T. pantotropha K7, T. pantotropha \\(\\Delta7\\), T. pantotropha \\(\\Delta7\\) [pMMBSEK] and T. pantotropha \\(\\Delta7\\) [pMMBY25F] using antibody raised against P. denitrificans cytochrome cd\\(_1\\). 40 \\(\\mu\\)g of protein was loaded in each lane and the samples were separated in a 6% acrylamide SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to nitrocellulose by semi-dry electroblotting and probed using the anti-cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) antibody. The 63 kDa band (mature cytochrome cd\\(_1\\)) and 47 kDa band (truncated cytochrome cd\\(_1\\)) are indicated by the upper and lower arrows respectively. Lanes: 1, T. pantotropha wild-type, 2, T. pantotropha K7, 3, T. pantotropha \\(\\Delta7\\), 4, T. pantotropha \\(\\Delta7\\) [pMMBSEK], 5, T. pantotropha \\(\\Delta7\\) [pMMBY25F]. Lanes that contained extract from T. pantotropha and T. pantotropha K7 each contained a band of the same mobility (63 kDa) that corresponded to mature cytochrome cd\\(_1\\). This band was absent in the extract from T. pantotropha \\(\\Delta7\\) and a new band of lower mobility (approximately 47 kDa) was detected in this extract. The plasmid pMMBSEK (described in Chapter 4) was used to complement the nirS deletion mutant with the wild-type nirS gene. The plasmid contained the nirS gene with its upstream promoter region, as well as a kanamycin resistance gene in the PstI site upstream of the NNR binding site. This arrangement provided a selectable marker in T. pantotropha and also meant that induction using IPTG was unnecessary. Plasmid pMMBSEK was transferred to T. pantotropha \\(\\Delta7\\) by conjugation from E. coli S17-1 and the transconjugants were selected on minimal succinate medium containing 100 \\(\\mu\\)g ml\\(^{-1}\\) kanamycin. The presence of the plasmid in T. pantotropha \\(\\Delta7\\) was confirmed by plasmid isolation and restriction digests using HindIII (not shown). The transformed cells were grown anaerobically in minimal succinate medium plus nitrate as before and the growth was compared with T. pantotropha, T. pantotropha K7 and T. pantotropha \\(\\Delta7\\) (Figure 6.14). Figure 6.14: Complementation of T. pantotropha \\(\\Delta7\\) using plasmid pMMBSEK. Overnight cultures of T. pantotropha, T. pantotropha \\(\\Delta7\\) and T. pantotropha \\(\\Delta7\\) [pMMBSEK] were inoculated at a dilution of 1/100 into minimal succinate medium plus 20 mM nitrate and growth was monitored by the increase in absorbance at 650 nm (logarithmic scale). Symbols: (◆) T. pantotropha, (■) T. pantotropha \\(\\Delta7\\), (▲) T. pantotropha \\(\\Delta7\\) [pMMBSEK]. Cells of T. pantotropha \\(\\Delta7\\) that contained pMMBSEK grew normally and reached a similar final optical density to the wild-type culture. The nitrite concentration in the culture medium from T. pantotropha \\(\\Delta7\\) [pMMBSEK] also followed a similar time course to that in wild- type culture (Figure 6.15). Figure 6.15: (a) Anaerobic growth of T. pantotropha \\(\\Delta7\\) [pMMBSEK] and (b) nitrite concentration in the medium during growth. An overnight culture of T. pantotropha \\(\\Delta7\\) [pMMBSEK] was inoculated 1/100 into minimal succinate medium plus 20 mM nitrate and growth was monitored by the increase in absorbance at 650 nm (logarithmic scale). 1 ml samples were removed at each time point, centrifuged and the supernatant was assayed colorimetrically for nitrite. A soluble extract was prepared from T. pantotropha [pMMBSEK] and probed for cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) using Western blotting. The expression of mature cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) was restored to the cells by pMMBSEK and the 63 kDa band stained slightly more strongly in this extract than in the wild-type lane (Figure 6.13). The 47 kDa hand observed in the extract from the deletion mutant T. pantotropha \\(\\Delta7\\) was also observed in the sample from T. pantotropha \\(\\Delta7\\) [pMMBSEK]. 6.2.3 Construction of a cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) mutant in which Tyr-25 is replaced by phenylalanine and expression of the mutant in T. pantotropha \\(\\Delta7\\) Once it had been demonstrated that the nirS deletion mutant could be complemented successfully using pMMBSEK, the next step was to try to express a site-directed mutant of cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) using the same system. The first such mutant to be tried was one in which Tyr-25 was replaced with phenylalanine (Y25F). The role of this residue was discussed in Chapter 3 and reasons for the choice of this mutant are discussed further in the next section. The DNA fragment containing the Y25F mutant of cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) was constructed by Dr. Simon Baker using the Promega Altered Sites II system. The mutagenic plasmid is outlined in Figure 6.16. Figure 6.16: Construction of the plasmid pVA191-Y25F containing the Y25F mutation in the nirS gene of T. pantotropha. A 600 bp EcoRI fragment from the plasmid pBNIR (Chapter 4, Table 4.1) containing approximately the first 500 bp of the nirS gene was cloned into the vector pALTER-1. The Promega Altered Sites II site-directed mutagenesis system was then used to anneal a mutagenic oligonucleotide to the gene, substituting phenylalanine for Tyr-25 and introducing a silent MluI restriction site for screening during later manipulations. The insert was then sequenced to check for secondary mutations. The relevant sequence of the gene is shown, with the Y25F and MluI mutations underlined. Enzymes: B, BamHI, E, EcoRI, H, HindIII, P, PstI, S, SalI. Plasmid pVA191-Y25F was constructed by Dr. Simon Baker. A 600 bp EcoRI fragment from the plasmid pBNIR (Chapter 4, Table 4.1), containing the first 500 bp of the nirS gene was ligated into the plasmid pALTER-1. Tyr-25 was mutated to phenylalanine using a mutant oligonucleotide that additionally contained a silent mutation to introduce a restriction site for MluI into the fragment. The latter mutation allowed for rapid screening of mutant clones during later manipulations and the mutant plasmid was named pVA191-Y25F. The strategy for insertion of the Y25F mutation into the full-length nirS gene is summarised in Figure 6.17. Figure 6.17: Construction of the expression plasmid pMMBY25F containing the Y25F mutation in the nirS gene of T. pantotropha. Only the relevant restriction fragments of each plasmid are shown. Full details of the plasmids are given in Table 6.1. Enzymes: B, BamHI, E, EcoRI, K, KpnI, M, MluI, N, NotI, P, (PstI), S, SacI. First, a BamHI - EcoRI fragment was removed from pVA191-Y25F. This fragment carried the Y25F mutation and was the same 382 bp of DNA that was removed from the nirS gene to construct unmarked deletion mutants described in Section 6.2.1. The 382 bp fragment was ligated into the plasmid pLN3N after first removing the equivalent fragment from the cloned nirS gene in pLN3N and the new plasmid, designated pLN3NY25F was screened for the presence of the new MluI site. The nirS gene containing the Y25F mutation was then cut from pLN3NY25F as a 2.4 kbp PstI - NotI fragment and ligated into the vector pBluescript II KS(+) which had been cut using the same enzymes. This construct was named pBY25F and was analysed by restriction digestion and by partial sequencing using the 610F primer (Chapter 3, Table 3.1) to confirm the cloning (Figure 6.18). Figure 6.18: Restriction digest analysis of plasmid pBY25FK. Following ligation and transformation, plasmid DNA was isolated from the transformed cells and digested using BamHI (lane 1), EcoRI (lane 2), HindIII (lane 3), SalI (lane 4), StyI (lane 5), KpnI - SacI (lane 6) and NruI (lane 7). Plasmid pBY25F from which pBY25FK was derived had previously been screened for the presence of the mutagenic MluI site. The pBluescript (II) vector contained one additional site for EcoRI, HindIII and SalI. Analysis of the digests showed that the construct was correct as shown in the diagram below the gel. Enzymes: B, BamHI, E, EcoRI, H, HindIII, K, KpnI, N, NruI, S, SalI, Sa, SacI, St, StyI. The lane labelled II contained DNA size standards, some of which are indicated at the left of the gel. To construct an expression plasmid containing the nirS Y25F mutant gene, the 1.2 kbp PstI fragment from pUC4K containing the kanamycin resistance gene was ligated into the PstI site of pBY25F and a 3.7 bp KpnI - SacI fragment containing this marker together with the mutated nirS gene was ligated into the broad host range vector pMMB67EH that had been cut with the same enzymes. The final plasmid, pMMBY25F, was thus identical to pMMBSEK except for the Y25F mutation in the nirS gene and was checked by digestion using MluI (Figure 6.19). Figure 6.19: Restriction digest analysis of plasmid pMMBY25F using MluI. Following ligation and transformation, plasmid DNA was isolated from the transformed cells and digested using MluI to check for the presence of the Y25F mutation in the nirS gene. Plasmid pMMB67EH into which the KpnI - SacI insert from pBY25FK was cloned contains a single MluI site, so this digest generated two fragments of approximate sizes 10.3 and 2.8 kbp, seen in lanes 1-7. Enzymes: K, KpnI, M, MluI, S, SacI. The lane labelled II contains DNA size standards, some of which are indicated at the left of the gel. pMMBY25F was transferred to T. pantotropha \\(\\Delta7\\) by conjugal transfer from E. coli S17-1 and the transconjugants were selected on minimal succinate medium containing 100 \\(\\mu\\)g ml\\(^{-1}\\) kanamycin. T. pantotropha \\(\\Delta7\\) [pMMBY25F] was then grown anaerobically in minimal succinate medium plus nitrate containing 100 \\(\\mu\\)g ml\\(^{-1}\\) kanamycin (Figure 6.20a). Figure 6.20: Comparison of (a) anaerobic growth and (b) nitrite accumulation in T. pantotropha \\(\\Delta7\\) [pMMBY25F] compared with that of T. pantotropha, T. pantotropha \\(\\Delta7\\) and T. pantotropha \\(\\Delta7\\) [pMMBSEK]. Overnight cultures of each strain were inoculated at a dilution of 1/100 into minimal succinate media plus 20 mM nitrate and growth was monitored by the increase in absorbance at 650 nm (logarithmic scale). 1 ml samples of each culture were removed at each time point and assayed colorimetrically for nitrite. Symbols: (◆) T. pantotropha, (■) T. pantotropha \\(\\Delta7\\), (▲) T. pantotropha \\(\\Delta7\\) [pMMBSEK], (x) T. pantotropha \\(\\Delta7\\) [pMMBY25F]. Growth of T. pantotropha \\(\\Delta7\\) [pMMBY25F] was virtually indistinguishable from that of the deletion mutants. Additionally, nitrite accumulated in the culture medium of T. pantotropha [pMMBY25F] to almost 20 mM just as was seen in the deletion mutant cultures (Figure 6.20b). A total soluble extract was prepared from T. pantotropha \\(\\Delta7\\) [pMMBY25F] and probed for cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) by Western blotting as described earlier (Figure 6.13). The 63 kDa band that corresponded to mature cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) was much fainter in this extract than in the extracts from wild-type, T. pantotropha K7 or T. pantotropha \\(\\Delta7\\) [pMMBSEK] and the 47 kDa band seen in the extracts from the deletion mutant was also present. Although the cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) Y25F mutant appeared to be inactive (as cultures of T. pantotropha \\(\\Delta7\\) [pMMBY25F] accumulated nitrite as though nitrite reductase were absent) and present in low amounts, partial purification of the protein was attempted. 20 l of T. pantotropha \\(\\Delta7\\) [pMMBY25F] was grown anaerobically overnight, harvested and spheroplasted to give 94 ml of periplasmic extract. The extract was bound to a DEAE Sepharose column and eluted using a linear gradient of NaCl. Elution of haem proteins was followed by measuring the absorbance of the fractions at 410 nm (Figure 6.21). Figure 6.21: Elution profile during ion exchange chromatography of soluble extract from anaerobically grown T. pantotropha \\(\\Delta7\\) [pMMBY25F]. 20 l of T. pantotropha \\(\\Delta7\\) [pMMBY25F] were grown anaerobically in minimal succinate medium plus 20 mM nitrate. A total soluble extract prepared from the cells was bound to a DEAE-Sepharose column (2 x 20 cm) and eluted with a 350 ml linear gradient of 0-400 mM NaCl in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 (◆). Elution of haem proteins was followed by measuring the absorbance of the fractions at 410 nm (■). Elution of the blue copper protein pseudoazurin in fractions 28-35 was monitored by absorbance at 595 nm (▲). The three major elution peaks are labelled numbers 2-4. As described in the text, a fourth c-type cytochrome eluted from the column either in the early fractions or during washing. In the above experiment this protein eluted during washing and was collected; however it is still referred to as peak 1. A pink band that bound weakly to the column was eluted during washing in some trials, or in the early part of the gradient in others; in Figure 6.21 this peak is not visible as it eluted during the wash, but it is referred to as Peak 1. Three other major peaks (2-4) eluted from the column at approximately 100, 150 and 220 mM NaCl respectively; these peak fractions were coloured pink, yellow-brown and dark brown respectively. Additionally, a blue coloured peak eluted from the column at approximately 50 mM NaCl; this peak was recorded by measuring its absorbance at 595 nm as shown in Figure 6.21. 15 \\(\\mu\\)l of the fraction from the top of Peaks 1-4 was separated by SDS-PAGE and stained in order to identify c-type cytochromes (Figure 6.22). Figure 6.22: SDS-PAGE gel of fractions eluting from the DEAE-Sepharose column during chromatography of soluble extract from T. pantotropha \\(\\Delta7\\) [pMMBY25F], stained for c-type cytochromes. 15 \\(\\mu\\)l of the top fraction from each peak was loaded on a 15% acrylamide SDS-PAGE gel, electrophoresed and stained for covalently-attached haem. The lane numbers refer to the peaks in Figure 6.21. Estimated molecular weights of the bands determined from an identical Coomassie-stained gel are indicated at the left of the gel. The weakly-binding pink fractions under Peak 1 contained a c-type cytochrome with a molecular weight of approximately 16 kDa. Peaks 2, 3 and 4 also contained c-type cytochromes with molecular weights on SDS-PAGE of 17, 12 and 45 kDa respectively. Peaks 1 and 3 did not stain strongly when Coomassie Blue was used to stain the gel (not shown). UV-visible spectroscopy was used to characterise further the coloured fractions. As isolated, peak 1 exhibited absorbance maxima at 406 and 528 nm (Figure 6.23a). Figure 6.23: Figure 6.23 Visible spectra of an unidentified c-type cytochrome from T. pantotropha [pMMBY25F]. As isolated, peak 1 showed absorbance maxima at 406 and 528 nm (a). When reduced with dithionite in the presence of air, the cytochrome auto-oxidised rapidly. Reduction under argon produced new absorbance maxima at 416, 521 and 550 nm (b). The spectra are characteristic of a cytochrome c. The cytochrome auto-oxidised rapidly after reduction using sodium dithionite, but when the reduction was performed under argon, absorbance maxima appeared at 416, 521 and 550 nm (Figure 623b). Fractions from under peak 1 had no nitrate reductase, nitrite reductase or cytochrome c oxidase activities (not shown). Spectroscopy of peaks 2 (Figure 6.24a) and 3 (Figure 6.24b) after reduction with sodium dithionite identified them as cytochrome c\\(_{550}\\) and cytochrome c’ respectively. Figure 6.24: Visible spectra of (a) cytochrome c\\(_{550}\\) and (b) cytochrome c’ from T. pantotropha [pMMBY25F]. Peak 2 had absorbance maxima at 415, 522 and 550 nm when reduced. It was identified by spectroscopy, elution position and size on SDS-PAGE as cytochrome c\\(_{550}\\). Peak 3 had absorbance maxima at 410, 500 and 604 nm when reduced and showed a shoulder to the red side of the peak at 410 nm. It was identified as being cytochrome c’ using the methods employed to identify cytochrome c\\(_{550}\\). The spectrum of the dark-brown coloured peak 3 exhibited absorbance maxima at 408, 526 and 639 nm as isolated (Figure 6.25a) and at 419, 524, 556 and 620 nm when reduced with sodium dithionite (Figure 6.25b). Figure 6.25: Visible spectra of cytochrome c peroxidase from T. pantotropha [pMMBY25F]. Peak 4 as isolated showed absorbance maxima at 408, 526 and 639 nm. When reduced with sodium dithionite, absorbance maxima were seen at 419, 524, 556 and 620 with a shoulder at the blue side of the 556 nm peak. Peak 4 was identified by spectroscopy, size on SDS-PAGE and enzyme assay as cytochrome c peroxidase. These spectra strongly resembled the published spectra of cytochrome c peroxidase from P. denitrificans (Gilmour et al., 1993)314 and when assayed the peak 3 fractions did have a significant peroxidase activity, oxidising 3.2 \\(\\mu\\)mol of horse heart cytochrome c per minute per \\(\\mu\\)l of fraction in the presence of 18 \\(\\mu\\)M H\\(_2\\)O\\(_2\\) (Figure 6.26). Figure 6.26: Assay of cytochrome c peroxidase activity in peak 4 following ion exchange chromatography. The assay was performed in a volume of 1 ml, containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 25 \\(\\mu\\)M horse heart cytochrome c and varying volumes of the fractions from the top of peak 4. After incubation of these components for 1 minute to reduce the peroxidase (Gilmour et al., 1994), the reaction was initiated by the addition of 18 \\(\\mu\\)M H\\(_2\\)O\\(_2\\). Oxidation of cytochrome c was followed by the decrease in absorbance at 550 nm. In addition to the cytochrome-containing fractions, the blue fractions 28-35 were identified by visible spectroscopy as the small copper protein pseudoazurin (Figure 6.27). Figure 6.27: Visible spectrum of pseudoazurin from T. pantotropha [pMMBY25F]. Fractions 28-35 (Figure 6.21) were coloured pale-blue. The blue material had absorbance maxima at 408, 587 and 739 nm as isolated. Although the spectrum does not exactly match published spectra for pseudoazurin from T. pantotropha (Moir et al. 1993), it could be identified by size on SDS-PAGE and elution position. The peak at 408 nm overlays a peak at 450 nm and probably indicates contamination of the pseudoazurin peak by the small cytochrome c in peak 1. However, no elution peak that corresponded to cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) was observed in several trials. A cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) elution peak was also absent when a hydrophobic phenyl Sepharose column was employed as the first purification step (not shown). 6.3 Discussion The method used to construct an unmarked deletion in the nirS gene of T. pantotropha has been used previously in the closely-related organism P. denitrificans PD1222 to mutate a number of genes including those encoding amicyanin (van Spanning et al., 1990),311 cytochrome c\\(_{551i}\\), cytochrome c\\(_{550}\\) and cytochrome c\\(_{553i}\\), (van Spanning et al., 1991a),312 the cytochrome c oxidases aa\\(_3\\) and cbb\\(_3\\) (van der Oost et al., 1995)315 and the genes moxJ and moxG which are involved in methanol oxidation (van Spanning et al., 1991b).316 The method has a number of advantages as compared to simple insertional mutagenesis using an antibiotic resistance cassette; first, in-frame deletions can be constructed in order to prevent polar effects on genes downstream of the mutated target gene and, second, the method allows for the construction of multiple mutations by the repeated insertion of a kanamycin marker into several targets followed by its replacement with the unmarked deletion. This is especially important for P. denitrificans in which few selectable markers have been reported (Steinrücke and Ludwig, 1993).257 The first step of the mutagenic procedure, insertion of the kanamycin cassette into the PstI site upstream of nirS, was accomplished quite easily. A large number of kanamycin resistant transconjugants were selected after mating and 15 out of 100 of these proved to be exconjugants when tested for spectinomycin susceptibility. This compares well with the frequency of 40% reported for kanamycin insertion mutagenesis of the cycA gene in P. denitrificans (van Spanning, 1991).310 The ease of this procedure was probably due in part to the extensive homologous regions each side of the kanamycin cassette in the mutagenic plasmid pGRPN3K, in which there was approximately 5.1 kbp and 2.1 kbp of DNA upstream and downstream respectively of the kanamycin cassette. It has been suggested that at least 1 kb of homologous DNA each side of the insertion region is desirable for efficient homologous recombination of both arms in P. denitrificans (Dr. Simon Baker, personal communication). Southern blotting using the labelled kanamycin cassette showed clearly that the fragment has inserted only once into the chromosome and the hybridisation of the fragment to genomic DNA digested with HindIII indicated that the insertion was at the correct site. This was confirmed by hybridisation of the labelled nirS gene fragment to DNA digested using StyI, although in this experiment hybridisation to the larger of the two expected fragments was very weak, probably due to the low region of overlap between the large fragment and the small nirS-derived probe. The second step of the method, replacement of the nirS gene and the kanamycin marker by an unmarked mutation was somewhat more difficult to achieve. This was largely due to difficulties experienced in ligating the blunted NotI fragment from pLN3N\\(\\Delta\\)nir into the blunt-ended SmaI site of pRVS1. Eventually this cloning was achieved by blunting the NotI ends using T7 DNA polymerase. Restriction analysis of the plasmid pRVS\\(\\Delta\\)nir was complicated by the lack of a published restriction map for this plasmid and by the observation that with certain enzymes (e.g. PstI) an anomalous restriction pattern was observed in which the sizes of the fragments produced did not appear to add up to the total size of the plasmid (11.6 kbp). However, the correctness of the construct was confirmed by a combination of restriction and PCR analyses, and ultimately by Southern blotting of the mutants obtained and their subsequent analysis. In future it would be advantageous to engineer fragments for cloning into pRVS1 to have the appropriate restriction sites at their termini and to have a detailed restriction map of the plasmid. Replacement of the chromosomal nirS gene with the unmarked deletion also proved to be quite challenging. To begin with, the procedure for selection of cells in which pRVS\\(\\Delta\\)nir had become integrated into the chromosome proved to be slightly different to the published protocol (van Spanning, 1991),310 in that a concentration of 20 \\(\\mu\\)g ml\\(^{-1}\\) of X-Gal in the plates was not sufficient to turn the colonies blue. At 40 \\(\\mu\\)g ml\\(^{-1}\\) the colonies were pale-blue. However, the presence of spectinomycin and kanamycin, both at 100 \\(\\mu\\)g ml\\(^{-1}\\), should have been sufficient to detect plasmid integrant strains. In the next stage of the published protocol cells are scraped from these plates, replated in the absence of antibiotics to promote excision of the plasmid from the chromosome, then collected once more and plated in the presence of a high X-Gal concentration to detect exconjugants, which colour white under these conditions. In the case of T. pantotropha very few white colonies were obtained in this way, and so a single colony was grown for two cycles in liquid culture to promote recombinational excision of the plasmid. The number of white colonies obtained was increased but was still very low; 25 were obtained after the second culture was diluted 10\\(^7\\) fold and plated on 10 plates, of which three colonies were kanamycin-sensitive and contained the deletion. The frequency is somewhat lower than that reported for deletion mutagenesis of the cycA gene in P. denitrificans (resolution frequency of 5 x 10\\(^{-4}\\), of which 25% were kanamycin-sensitive, van Spanning 1990).310 Growth of the deletion mutant strains revealed the expected phenotype as compared with the wild-type cells; in the absence of cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) the nitrite produced by nitrate reductase activity accumulates rapidly to levels beyond which the cells no longer grow. It is notable that the maximum nitrite concentration reached was practically equal to that of the nitrate supplied originally in the medium, indicating that even if the cells are not growing nitrate reductase activity is able to continue quite efficiently. The peak nitrite concentration reached in cultures containing the kanamycin insertion was somewhat higher than in the wild-type strain, indicating that nitrite reduction in this strain was impaired. On a Western blot, slightly less cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) was observed in this mutant strain, and when harvested, the cells were noticeably pink compared to the wild-type. The kanamycin insertion lies in the promoter region of the nirI gene, which is known to be involved in the regulation of nirS expression (de Boer, 1996). It is probable that in this mutant expression of nirI is impaired but not abolished, allowing the formation of some active cytochrome cd\\(_1\\). The pink colour of the cell pellet is possibly due to the expression of some semi-apo cytochrome cd\\(_1\\), which is pink as it lacks the d\\(_1\\) haem, and/or to the attenuated level of holo-cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) which normally colours the cell pellet brown. Western blotting of the cell extracts from the deletion mutants showed that cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) was absent, but revealed the presence of a new band with an approximate molecular weight of 47 kDa. This band was specific to the deletion mutant and cells derived from it (it was also observed in T. pantotropha \\(\\Delta7\\) carrying the plasmids pMMBSEK and pMMBY25F, but not in the extracts from wild-type cells or from T. pantotropha K7). The most likely explanation for this band is that it represents a truncated form of cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) generated by the removal of the 382 bp BamHI - EcoRI fragment. During the latter procedure the cohesive termini generated by restriction using these enzymes were filled in using T4 DNA polymerase. Without sequencing across this junction it is not possible to know precisely what junction was formed, as the polymerase may have removed some nucleotides from either terminus as well as filling in the ends. However, analysis of the truncated gene using the program SeqAid (Roufa and Rhoads, 1989)317 indicates that the procedure may have generated two new open reading frames. The first of these begins at the original ATG start codon and is 264 bp long, encoding for 88 amino acids and is unlikely to be relevant. The second begins at an ATG codon after the deletion and encodes a polypeptide of 429 amino acids long (47.8 kDa) and this protein may be the species that is cross-reacting on the Western blot. The presence of this polypeptide is not significant in terms of the later complementation and mutagenesis experiments as it is unlikely to be periplasmic in the absence of a targeting sequence, is clearly not active and does not contain the region in which the Y25F mutation was made and so could not exchange this residue with the mutated residue on plasmid pMMBY25F. Complementation of the deletion mutant T. pantotropha \\(\\Delta7\\) using the plasmid pMMBSEK was successful, as shown by the restoration of growth on nitrate and the presence of the cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) polypeptide by Western blotting. The latter technique showed that there was a significant, but not excessive, increase in the amount of expressed protein from the plasmid as compared with the chromosomal copy of the gene, indicating that the copy number is quite low in T. pantotropha as was discussed in Chapter 5. The increased levels of cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) do not seem to have had a deleterious effect on the regulation of denitrification in the cells as judged by analysis of the growth curves and of nitrite levels in the culture medium, both of which were very similar to wild-type cultures. pMMBSEK proved to be a good choice of plasmid for these experiments; it contains the kanamycin resistance gene which is selectable in T. pantotropha and the upstream promoter region which seems to be fully functional, removing the need for induction using IPTG. The last point is important as the tac promoter is believed to function quite poorly in P. denitrificans (Dr. M.L.D. Page and Dr. E. Gordon, personal communication). Having demonstrated that the nirS deletion mutant could be complemented successfully with a plasmid the next step was to try complementation using a site-directed mutant of the nirS gene. The first mutant chosen was one in which Tyr-25 was mutated to phenylalanine. The role of Tyr-25 was discussed in Chapter 3; it is a ligand to the d\\(_1\\) haem in the oxidised enzyme structure and is postulated to displace nitric oxide from the haem iron during the catalytic cycle of nitrite reduction (Fülöp et al., 1995).127 This crucial role made Tyr-25 an attractive candidate for mutagenesis. Phenylalanine was chosen as a replacement residue as it has the same core structure as tyrosine, lacking only the hydroxyl group; the latter feature would be expected to prevent bonding to the d\\(_1\\) haem iron. Additionally, Tyr-25 is located on the 382 bp BamHI - EcoRI fragment that was removed from the chromosomal nirS gene to make the deletion mutant. This facilitated the construction of the mutant as the same fragment could be inserted into the expression plasmid as a cassette and screened for using the silent MluI restriction site. The absence of the residue in the chromosomal copy of the gene also meant that it could not be transferred to the plasmid by homologous recombination, although the probability of this kind of transfer is quite low and can always be monitored by isolation of the plasmid from the cells and restriction analysis or sequencing. One other possibility is that of reversion, in which the Y25F mutant of the nirS gene might be transferred to the chromosome by homologous recombination and then repaired by random mutation to give the wild-type gene. However, this is most unlikely as the amount of homologous overlapping DNA between the plasmid and the chromosome is quite low, especially at the 5’-end and, additionally, reversion is extremely rare in P. denitrificans except under conditions of extreme selective pressure (Steinrücke and Ludwig, 1993).257 Growth of T. pantotropha \\(\\Delta7\\) [pMMBY25F) anaerobically on nitrate showed a phenotype that was virtually identical to that of the deletion mutants, with poor growth and an accumulation of nitrite to toxic levels. This was taken initially as evidence that the expressed protein was not active. However, Western blotting showed that only very low amounts of the protein were present. This might have been a consequence of the low yield of cells (an ideal control experiment at this stage, although not possible in the present work, would have been to compare the level of cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) to that in cells in which denitrification was impaired due to another cause, such as mutations in other electron transfer components), but the amount of cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) seemed abnormally low even taking the poor growth into account. To investigate this further 20 l of cells were grown and partial purification of cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) was attempted from a periplasmic extract. Despite several trials no cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) was isolated from a DEAE-Sepharose ion-exchange column in these experiments. By contrast the amounts of cytochrome c\\(_{550}\\) and cytochrome c’ (proteins that are normally observed during cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) purification) seemed to be close to or even slightly higher than what would have been expected when taking into account the reduced growth of the cells as compared to wild-type cultures. These results indicate that the Y25F mutation resulted in a greatly attenuated level of expressed cytochrome cd\\(_1\\), perhaps as a result of degradation of the protein. Unfortunately, this result does not allow a definite conclusion as to whether Tyr-25 is essential for the enzymatic activity of cytochrome cd\\(_1\\), since it was not possible to isolate sufficient quantities of the mutant enzyme for kinetic analyses. However, as the mutant was expressed in vivo in T. pantotropha, it can be stated that Tyr-25 is certainly a vital residue in some sense. One possible reason for the postulated degradation could be that Tyr-25 plays an important structural role during assembly of the enzyme. As well as ligating to the d\\(_1\\) haem iron, Tyr-25 is hydrogen-bonded via a water molecule to the residues His-345 and His-388 in the oxidised structure of cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) (Baker et al., 1997b)262 and so is structurally important. It may be that some or all of the above interactions are important during the assembly and folding of cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) in vivo and that their absence in the Y25F mutant accounts for its degradation. However, an equally valid argument is that the absence of enzymatic activity in the Y25F mutant leads to the degradation of the enzyme as the cells experience increasingly non-physiological conditions because of the accumulation of nitrite. Notably, Tyr-25 is disordered in the reduced structure of cytochrome cd\\(_1\\), which is likely to be the physiologically-relevant form (Chapter 3) and so at least some degree of complementation using pMMBY25F might have been expected, had the Y25F mutant been active. The growth of T. pantotropha \\(\\Delta7\\) [pMMBY25F] is essentially identical to that of the deletion mutant alone and some interesting observations can be made concerning the cytochrome content of the cells. First, a small c-type cytochrome was observed (approximately 16 kDa on SDS-PAGE) which bound only weakly to the DEAE-Sepharose column, stained poorly with Coomassie Blue and auto-oxidised following reduction using sodium dithionite. This cytochrome has not been observed previously during purification of cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) from wild-type cultures of T. pantotropha and its function is unknown. The spectrum of the cytochrome did not correspond to any known published spectrum of c-type cytochromes from P. denitrificans or other organisms, and so N-terminal sequencing would be a useful first step in an attempt to identify this protein. It may be expressed as a consequence of stress placed on the cells by the high nitrite concentration. Further evidence that the mutant cells grown under these conditions are under some form of oxidative stress was deduced from the elevated levels of cytochrome c peroxidase found in the cells. Normally this protein is seen only as a small absorbance at 410 nm eluting just before cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) from the DEAE-Sepharose column when wild-type cells are grown anaerobically with nitrate. However, in the mutant culture cytochrome c peroxidase was the major c-type cytochrome. It was also notable that elevated levels of the small blue copper protein pseudoazurin were present, giving a blue colour to the fractions in which the protein eluted that was clearly visible to the eye. Although the yield of pseudoazurin from wild-type T. pantotropha has been reported as 0.6 mg l\\(^{-1}\\) (Moir, 1993),238 the protein has been consistently difficult to detect during routine purification of cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) over the course of the present work. The amounts observed in this case seem especially significant when the poor cell yield is considered. This observation may indicate that pseudoazurin is produced in response to oxidative stress and/or it may be an electron donor to cytochrome c peroxidase in an analogous role to the similar protein azurin (Ronnberg et al., 1981).318 The complementation of the nirS deletion mutant using pMMBSEK has shown that this is a viable expression system for cytochrome cd\\(_1\\), provided that the recombinant protein is stable. Although the growth of the cells is poor the final optical density is still equivalent to that of wild-type cells in early exponential phase and the yield of other cytochromes from the ion-exchange column indicates that enough cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) could be obtained for further studies, provided that it was not degraded. It may also be possible to increase the cell yield by dialysis culture to remove the toxic nitrite produced or by simply growing larger culture volumes. However, the potential instability of mutants such as Y25F presents a different problem. As the mutant cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) could not be isolated from scaled-up cultures, it was not possible to find out whether Tyr-25 was an essential residue for catalysis. This question might be answered using the reconstitution of the expressed semi-apo protein from E. coli that was described in Chapter 4. In this case the assembly of the protein differs to that in vivo, in that it does not depend on the presence of Tyr-25 to ligand with the d\\(_1\\) haem during synthesis and folding because the d\\(_1\\) haem is not present. It may therefore be possible to insert the haem by reconstitution into semi-apo cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) Y25F and determine whether the protein is catalytically active. The comments from Chapter 4 concerning improvements to the expression system and standardisation of the reconstitution protocol are equally valid here. Additionally, there are a large number of other potential targets for site-directed mutagenesis that may still be tried using expression in T pantotropha \\(\\Delta7\\) or in E. coli. These include His-17 which is the proximal ligand to the c-haem in the oxidised structure, Met-106, the proximal c-haem ligand in the reduced structure and His-345 or His-388, which are believed to act as proton donors during the dehydration of nitrite at the active site. The first two of these lie in the 382 bp deleted region of the nirS gene and could be constructed in much the same way as the Y25F mutant described in this chapter.

Most of the work in this field has been performed in Ps. stutzeri Zobell. In this organism, transcription start site analysis has been reported for the genes fnrA (Cuypers and Zumft, 1993),204 norCB (Zumft et al., 1994),320 and nosZ (Cuypers et al., 1995)219 and Northern blotting has been used to determine the major transcripts from these genes. Northern blotting of transcripts from the nirS gene region has also been reported (Zumft, 1995).220 Similar analysis of the nor genes (Bartnikas et al., 1997)321 and the nirK gene which encodes a copper nitrite reductase (Tosques et al., 1997)322 have been performed using Rhodobacter sphaeroides. In other cases sequence analysis has been employed, as in the nir operon of Ps. aeruginosa (Kawasaki et al., 1997)221 to look for transcription terminator features that might indicate the size of gene transcripts. In P. denitrificans transcriptional analysis is very much in its infancy; very few genes have had their transcription start sites determined and little is known about the promoter regions of any gene family. More experimental data from P. denitrificans would be extremely valuable as much of the regulation of denitrification is likely to occur at the level of transcription. Identification of promoters and the proteins that interact with them could improve our understanding of how denitrifying organisms sense environmental factors such as oxygen tension and nitrate concentration and co-ordinate the expression of the many genes involved in denitrification. The experiments described in this chapter had two objectives: first to measure the size of the transcript from the nirS gene and second, to determine the transcription start site using two different methods. Following discussion of the results an analysis of NNR dependent genes is presented with the aim of discussing some of the possible ways in which the transcription of the nirS gene may be regulated. Finally, some ideas for future experiments in this area are discussed. 7.2 Results The starting material for the experiments described in this chapter was total RNA extracted from T. pantotropha that had been grown anaerobically to mid-exponential phase. The extraction method was based on a number of methods rather than on one specific protocol; cell lysis under denaturing conditions and phenol-chloroform extraction was based on the method of Chattopadhyay et al. (1993).247 A 50 ml culture typically yielded 150-200 \\(\\mu\\)g of total RNA with a ratio of absorbances at A\\(_{260}\\):A\\(_{280}\\) of 1.5-1.9, which is considered to be of sufficient quality for further work (Chirgwin et al., 1979).323 The extracted total RNA was separated using denaturing formaldehyde agarose gel electrophoresis to determine whether degradation had occurred during the extraction procedure. Figure 7.1 shows a gel containing a sample of RNA from T. pantotropha that has been run alongside a total RNA extract from Escherichia coli (prepared in the same way as that from T. pantotropha) and a sample of total RNA from human cells (obtained from Dr. Stuart Wilson, University of Oxford). Figure 7.1: Analysis of total RNA samples from human cells, E. coli and T. pantotropha using denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis. Total RNA samples from human HeLa cells (lane 1, 10 \\(\\mu\\)g, obtained from Dr. Stuart Wilson, University of Oxford), E. coli (lane 2, 10 \\(\\mu\\)g) and T. pantotropha (lane 3, 15 \\(\\mu\\)g from anaerobically grown cells and lane 4, 15 \\(\\mu\\)g from aerobically grown cells) were denatured by heating in 50% formamide as described by Grierson (1990) and electrophoresed in a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel. The samples were stained by adding ethidium bromide at 0.033 \\(\\mu\\)g/\\(\\mu\\)l to the sample loading buffer. The sizes of RNA size standards (not visible on the photograph) are indicated at the left of the gel. Ribosomal RNA sizes (28S = 4718 bases, 23S = 2904 bases, 18S = 1874 bases, 16S = 1541 bases) are shown at the right of the gel. Under these conditions two bright bands of ribosomal RNA and a faint smear of messenger RNA should be observed. In the case of E. coli the 23S and 16S ribosomal RNA molecules are 2904 (Brosius et al., 1980)324 and 1541 nucleotides long (Brosius et al., 1978),325 respectively. Undegraded RNA should exhibit a 2:1 staining ratio for the 23S and 16S rRNA species (Chirgwin et al., 1979).323 The sample from T. pantotropha contained two strongly-staining bands of RNA, but the upper band ran with the same mobility as the 16S RNA species whereas the lower band was smaller, with an estimated size of approximately 900 bases. This result is discussed further in the following section, but it results from the fragmentation of the 23S rRNA molecule and in this case does not indicate that the RNA is degraded. The length of the nirS transcript was determined using Northern blotting. For this experiment 5, 10 and 20 \\(\\mu\\)g samples of total RNA from T. pantotropha were separated by electrophoresis on a 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane by capillary transfer using 20x SSC. The lane containing RNA size standards was removed from the blot and stained using methylene blue. The transferred RNA was then hybridised with a DNA probe of 141 bp in length, which had been generated from T. pantotropha genomic DNA using a PCR reaction with the primers nirSF and 228R (Table 3.1, Chapter 3). The probe was labelled with dUTP-digoxigenin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate. Following hybridisation and washing, the hybridised probe was visualised colorimetrically using a stain for the conjugated alkaline phosphatase activity (Figure 7.2). Figure 7.2: Northern blot of total RNA from anaerobically grown T. pantotropha using a nirS-derived probe. 10 \\(\\mu\\)g of RNA from E. coli (lane 1) and 5, 10 and 20 \\(\\mu\\)g of RNA from anaerobically grown T. pantotropha (lanes 2-4) were separated by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel transferred to a positive nylon membrane and hybridised with a probe to the nirS gene, labelled with digoxigenin alkaline-phosphatase conjugate. After washing, the hybridised probe was detected colorimetrically. A single band with a mobility of approximately 1.85 kb was detected in the lanes containing RNA from T. pantotropha. The relative positions of the 23S (2904 bases) and 16S (1542 bases) ribosomal RNA species are shown at the left of the blot. In all lanes a single band with an approximate size of 1.85 kb was detected. Northern blotting was also performed using chemiluminescent detection of the probe with the alkaline phosphatase substrate CSPD. This technique is several times more sensitive than the colorimetric detection method and was used to look for minor transcripts of different sizes. However, only the same 1.85 kb band was detected in these experiments (Figure 7.3). Figure 7.3: Northern blot of total RNA from anaerobically grown T. pantotropha, using a nirS-derived probe together with chemiluminescent detection. 10 \\(\\mu\\)g of RNA from T. pantotropha grown anaerobically (lane 3) and aerobically (lane 2) and 10 \\(\\mu\\)g of RNA from E. coli (lane 1) were separated by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel, transferred to positive nylon and hybridised to a probe for the nirS gene as in Figure 7.2. The hybridised probe was detected using the chemiluminescent alkaline phosphatase substrate CSPD and the blot was exposed to X-ray film for 1 hour. A single band of approximate mobility 1.85 kb was detected in the lane containing RNA from anaerobically grown T. pantotropha. The very high stringency of the chemiluminescent detection protocol meant that no background was visible on the developed film; the outline of the original blot is the frame of the photograph. The relative positions of the 23S (2904 bases) and 16S (1541 bases) ribosomal RNAs species are shown at the left of the blot.

The relative positions of the 23S (2904 bases) and 16S (1541 bases) ribosomal RNAs species are shown at the left of the blot. Northern blotting was also attempted using a 428 bp SphI DNA fragment containing the ends of the nirE (3’-end) and nirC (5’-end) genes as a probe, but no transcripts were detected in these experiments (results not shown). A primer extension experiment was performed using a sample of T. pantotropha RNA in order to determine the transcription start point of the mRNA transcribed from the nirS gene. Three oligonucleotides were synthesised, designated 284R, 242R and 228R, that were homologous to the reverse strand of the early region of the nirS gene (Figure 7.4). Figure 7.4: Location of primers used in primer extension and 5’-RACE experiments to determine the transcription start site of the T. pantotropha nirS gene. The upstream region of the nirS gene is shown, covering the putative promoter region and the first 88 codons of the nirS gene. The NNR box is in bold, the ATG start codon is underlined and a putative ribosome binding site is dash-underlined. The locations of the three reverse primers 284R, 242R and 228R are indicated by arrows. The specificity of the oligonucleotides was analysed using PCR reactions with genomic DNA from T. pantotropha and the nirSF primer (Chapter 3, Table 3.1), which gave specific products of 197, 155 and 141 bp respectively (not shown). Early trials of the primer extension experiment indicated that the 228R primer was most specific for annealing to mRNA and so this primer was chosen for further work. The 228R primer was labelled at the 5’-end with \\(\\gamma\\)-\\(^{32}\\)P-ATP and approximately 10\\(^5\\) cpm of labelled primer was annealed to 40 \\(\\mu\\)g of total RNA from T. pantotropha. Avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV) reverse transcriptase was then used to synthesise a cDNA extending from the labelled primer to the 5’-end of the nirS mRNA molecule (the 3’-end of the cDNA). The labelled cDNA was recovered by organic extraction and precipitation. It was then electrophoresed on a standard 6% acrylamide sequencing gel alongside a sequencing ladder generated using the 228R primer and the plasmid pTNIR3 (Chapter 4 Figure 4.2) as template DNA. The relevant portion of this gel is shown in Figure 7.5. Figure 7.5: Primer extension product synthesised from nirS mRNA, compared with a sequencing ladder generated from the nirS gene using the same primer. 10 pmol of the primer 228R was labelled at the 5’-end using 50 \\(\\mu\\)Ci of \\(\\gamma\\)-\\(^{32}\\)P-ATP and approximately 10\\(^5\\) cpm of the labelled primer was annealed to 40 \\(\\mu\\)g of total RNA from anaerobically-grown T. pantotropha. cDNA was extended from the labelled primer-template using 200 U of MMLV reverse transcriptase. The labelled cDNA product was precipitated redissolved and run on a 6% acrylamide sequencing gel alongside a sequencing ladder generated from the plasmid pTNIR3 (Chapter 4) and the 228R primer. Part of the sequence is shown at the left of the sequencing ladder and the G residue indicating the transcription start site with an asterisk. The sequencing ladder is not of high quality but as described in the text, previous knowledge of the nirS gene sequence and the results of the 5’-RACE experiment (Figure 7.10) allowed the transcription start site to be assigned unambiguously. The sequencing reactions were not of high quality in this case and it was not possible to replicate the reactions before the activity of the labelled cDNA had reached unusable levels. However, it was clear that the labelled cDNA product ran with the same mobility as a guanine residue, 29 residues upstream of the nirS ATG start codon on the sequencing ladder. The NNR-binding site upstream of the nirS gene was also clearly visible on the sequencing gel and as the segment of DNA has been sequenced many times previously during sequencing of the nirS gene, it was possible to assign confidently a transcription start site for the nirS mRNA, as shown in Figure 7.6. Figure 7.6: The upstream region of the T. pantotropha nirS gene, showing the transcription start site as determined using primer extension and 5’-RACE. The transcription start site is a G residue (double-underlined) 29 bp upstream of the ATG start codon (single-underlined). Other features are the putative ribosome binding site (dotted underlined) and the NNR box (bold). The reverse primers used in each experiment are shown by arrows. The bases 10, 35 and 41 bp upstream of the transcription start site are also indicated. To confirm this result, the method of 5’-RACE (Frohman, 1993)250 was employed to provide an independent estimate of the transcription start site. The basis of the method is outlined in Figure 7.7. Figure 7.7: Figure 7.7 Schematic diagram illustrating the principle of the 5’-RACE method. (a) A reverse primer, R1, is used to synthesise a cDNA molecule from mRNA. The 3’-end of the cDNA is the complement of the transcription start site. (b) A poly-A tail is added to the 3’-end of the cDNA. (c) This allows several PCR cycles using the reverse primer R1 and the forward primer QTF, which contains a poly-T sequence and binding sites for two further forward primers Q0F and Q1F. (d) PCR is performed using the forward primer QOF and a second reverse primer R2. (e) final PCR reaction is performed using Q1F and a third reverse primer, R3, to increase specific (f) The final PCR product is cloned and sequenced; the transcription start site corresponds to the first base after the poly-A region. As in the primer extension, experiment an oligonucleotide (R1) is first annealed to the specific mRNA and a cDNA is synthesised, the 3’-end of which corresponds to the 5’-end of the mRNA transcript. A tail of dATP residues is then added to the 3’-end of the cDNA using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. This allows a set of nested PCR reactions to be performed, using three forward primers (QTF, QOF and Q1F, Frohman 1993) and two further reverse primers, R2 and R3. The PCR product so generated can be cloned and sequenced conventionally and the 5’-end of the mRNA corresponds to the first residue seen after the poly-dATP tail on the sequencing ladder. In the 5’-RACE experiment the primer 284R was annealed to nirS mRNA and extended using Moloney murine leukaemia virus (MMLV) reverse transcriptase to generate cDNA. Following initial PCR amplification using the QTF primer and 284R, nested PCR reactions were carried out using first QOF plus 242R and then Q1F plus 228R An aliquot of the last PCR reaction was electrophoresed on a 1.4% agarose gel (Figure 7.8). Figure 7.8: Analysis using agarose gel electrophoresis of the PCR product generated from nirS mRNA by 5’-RACE. Following cDNA synthesis using the primer 284R (Figure 7.4) and the addition of a poly-A tail to the cDNA product, three PCR reactions were performed using the primer pairs QTF + 284R, QOF + 242R and Q1F + 228R (see Figure 7.7). 10 \\(\\mu\\)l of the final PCR reaction were separated by electrophoresis on a 1.2% agarose gel. Lanes 1 and 2 show a single PCR product of approximately 200 bp in length. To optimise the PCR reaction different conditions were used in the last PCR reaction; lane 1 used a high-salt buffer and lane 2 used low-salt buffer. The lane labelled M contains DNA size standards, the sizes of some of which are indicated at the left of the gel. After optimisation of the PCR reactions, a single PCR product of approximately 200 bp was present in the sample. The PCR product was purified from the gel and ligated into plasmid pGEM-T. The presence of the insert was confirmed, following blue-white selection, by digestion using the restriction enzymes SphI and NdeI (Figure 7.9). Figure 7.9: Restriction digest analysis of the cloned PCR products generated from nirS mRNA by 5’-RACE. The 200 bp PCR product generated by PCR using the primers Q1F and 284R (Figure 7.8) was cloned into the T-vector pGEM-T. Following blue-white selection, positive clones were digested using the enzymes SphI and NdeI. These enzymes cut once each side of the multiple cloning site but not in the nirS gene sequence and therefore were a good screen for the presence of a cloned insert. Three of the clones (lanes 1, 2 and 5) contained the expected 200 bp insert. the other clones (lanes 3 and 4) contained a smaller insert. Sequencing of the latter clones showed that the smaller insert originated in the coding region of the nirS gene and therefore resulted for incomplete cDNA synthesis during 5’-RACE. The lanes labelled III and II contained DNA size standards, some of which are indicated to of the gel. The digests revealed that some of the clones contained a smaller insert than expected. Digestion of the plasmids using BamHI produced a single linear fragment of 3.2 kbp, consistent with the presence of a single BamHI site in the early region of the nirS gene (not shown). One of each of the plasmids containing the larger and smaller inserts was sequenced using the M13 universal forward and reverse primers. The sequencing ladder generated from the plasmid containing the larger insert is shown in Figure 7.10. Figure 7.10: Sequence of the cloned PCR product synthesised from nirS mRNA by 5’-RACE. The PCR product generated using the primers Q1F and 228R (see text for details) was cloned into the vector pGEM-T (Figure 7.9) and sequenced using the M13F universal primer. The Q1F primer can be read from the sequence and is followed by 11 T residues, representing the poly-A tail that was added to the cDNA following its synthesis from the nirS mRNA. The residue immediately following the poly-T sequence is a G residue (asterisked). This residue indicates the 5’-end of the mRNA and is the same residue as that identified by primer extension. The Q1F primer sequence and poly-dATP tail were clearly visible. Following the poly-dATP tail was a guanine residue and comparison to the sequence of the nirS gene showed that this was the same guanine residue detected by the primer extension experiment. Sequence from the plasmid containing the smaller insert started within the coding region of the nirS gene, indicating that the cDNA generated in this case was truncated and had not reached the 5’-end of the transcript. 7.3 Discussion Isolation of prokaryotic RNA can be technically challenging due to the short half-life of bacterial mRNA (typically 1-2 minutes, Ra and Saris, 1995)326 and the problem of contamination with both endogenous and exogenous RNases. The quality of isolated RNA is determined by two main measurements: a ratio of absorbances at 260 and 280 nm of 1.7 2.0 and a 23S:16S rRNA intensity ratio of 2:1 when stained with ethidium bromide after denaturing gel electrophoresis. Total RNA isolated from T. pantotropha contained two major bands that stained with ethidium bromide in a 2:1 ratio, but comparison with RNA from E. coli showed that the 23S rRNA band was largely absent in these samples, having apparently degraded to a 16S rRNA sized species and a smaller species. However this is not indicative of general degradation in the RNA samples. Specific degradation of the 23S RNA molecule has been observed during RNA isolation from the bacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus (Yu et al., 1982),327 an organism that is very closely related to T. pantotropha. In the latter case it was demonstrated that intact 23S rRNA could be isolated using sucrose density gradient centrifugation and the conditions of gel electrophoresis (in particular a low concentration of divalent cations) were responsible for the observed degradation. Fragmentation of the 23S rRNA molecule has also been observed in Rhodospirillum rubrum (Chow, 1976),328 Rhodobacter sphaeroides (Marrs and Kaplan, 1970)329 and Agrobacterium tumefaciens (Grienenberger and Simon, 1975).330 In the latter case degradation of the 23S rRNA is proposed to occur in vivo during maturation of the ribosome. Thus it is clear that 23S rRNA degradation is common to several members of the \\(\\alpha\\)-Proteobacteria, including species that are closely related to T. pantotropha. The positive results of the experiments described in this chapter also show that the nirS mRNA that was isolated cannot have been severely degraded. Northern blotting using a DNA probe for the nirS gene identified a single transcript that was approximately 1.85 kb long. The coding region of the nirS gene is 1788 bp long and in P. denitrificans PD1222 is followed by the genes nirE (864 bp), nirC (309 bp), nirF (1155 bp) and nirD (645 bp) (de Boer et al., 1994).141 Preliminary sequencing and restriction analysis of the nir locus in T. pantotropha indicates the presence of at least nirE and nirC. The 1.85 kb mRNA species is therefore a nirS transcript. Knowledge of the nirS gene transcription start site described later in this chapter allows an approximate placement of the end of the nirS transcript between the nirS and nirE genes (Figure 7.11). Figure 7.11: Model for transcriptional termination of the T. pantotropha nirS gene. The length of the nirS mRNA is estimated at 1.85 kb by Northern blotting (Figure 7.2). Alignment of the mRNA with the nirS and nirE genes places the end of the mRNA between the two genes, just before a strong inverted repeat. The TGA stop codon of the nirS gene is underlined. The repeat could form a stem-loop structure as shown in the diagram and is followed by a relatively AT-rich region. This feature strongly resembles rho-dependent terminators in other genes. A second inverted repeat of unknown function before the putative terminator is indicated by inward-facing arrows. The intergenic sequence is numbered according to the sequence presented in Chapter 3. An imperfect inverted repeat 18 bp long (described in Chapter 3) lies between these two genes This feature was originally annotated as an oxygen responsive element in the P. denitrificans PD1222 nir locus, but it bears little resemblance to other ORE features and the annotation has subsequently been withdrawn (de Boer et al., 1994).141 It seems more likely that the inverted repeat is involved in terminating the transcription of the nirS gene. The GC-rich region can form a stem-loop structure as shown in Figure 7.11 and together with an AT-rich region downstream of the repeat, the structure is very similar to a rho-independent termination site (Farnham and Platt, 1980).331 Transcription of the nir region in T. pantotropha thus appears to differ from that of the nir genes in Ps. stutzeri Zobell and Ps. aeruginosa. In Ps. stutzeri Zobell two transcripts containing either nirS or nirS plus nirT have been detected (Zumft, 1995),220 whilst in Ps. aeruginosa no transcript analysis has been performed to date, although analysis of the nir region suggests a large single transcript containing the genes nirSMCFDLGHJEN terminated by a stem-loop structure (Bartnikas et al., 1997).321 Chemiluminescent detection of the nirS gene probe using a high-stringency protocol that is at least as sensitive as \\(^{32}\\)P-based methods (Engler-Blum et al., 1993)249 failed to detect any longer transcripts from T. pantotropha in the present work. However, it is still possible that longer transcripts including the nirS gene are present in vivo; they may be present at only very low levels or, alternatively, very large transcripts may not be efficiently transferred to the nylon membrane prior to hybridisation. Transfer of large mRNA molecules can be improved by partial hydrolysis prior to blotting (Sambrook et al., 1989)235 and it would be of interest to repeat the experiment using this technique. Northern blotting was attempted using a labelled DNA probe derived from parts of the nirE and nirC gene but no transcript was detected. It may be that the transcript containing these genes was not detectable for the reasons described above. Alternatively the probe may not have been of sufficient quality; although the nirS gene probe efficiently detected the nirS transcript, single-stranded RNA probes are preferred for Northern blotting (Melton et al., 1984).332 In future experiments it would be valuable to synthesise riboprobes from the nir genes for Northern blotting. The transcription start site of the nirS gene was identified as a guanine residue 29 bp upstream of the nirS ATG start codon. The sequencing ladder used in the primer extension experiment was not of high quality, but as described in the results section assignment of the start site was possible with prior knowledge of the nirS gene sequence in the relevant region. Additionally, the independent method of 5’-RACE gave the same result for the start site. The guanine residue is a good candidate for the authentic transcription start site as mRNA transcripts most often begin with a G or an A residue (Hawley and McClure, 1983)333 and the start site is -41.5 bp downstream of the centre of the NNR box. The spacing is the same as that observed between the FNR-binding site and the transcription start site in E. coli genes that are activated by FNR (Eiglmeier et al., 1989).334 Once the transcription start site of the nirS gene had been identified it was possible to look for upstream sequence features that might be involved in transcriptional regulation. The first observation is that there are no sequences which resemble the -10 and -35 hexamers seen upstream of sigma-70 dependent genes from other species of bacteria, particularly E. coli. In E. coli these regions are well characterised and consist of the consensus sequence TTGACA-N\\(_{16-18}\\)-TATAAT, where the TTGACA sequence is centred at -35 and the TATAAT sequence (or Pribnow box) is centred at -10 from the transcription start site (Hawley and McClure, 1983).333 The -35 and -10 sequences are involved in binding the \\(\\sigma^{70}\\) subunit of the RNA polymerase holoenzyme (Siebenlist et al. 1980).335 There is evidence that T. pantotropha probably does contain a \\(\\sigma^{70}\\) dependent RNA polymerase; a recent survey of genes from P. denitrificans and other \\(\\alpha\\)-Proteobacteria in which the transcription start site is known has shown that a similar \\(\\sigma^{70}\\) consensus sequence can be discerned in some instances (Baker et al. 1998).336 Additionally, the gene xylE cloned in a broad host range vector under the control of the \\(\\sigma^{70}\\)-dependent bacteriophage T4 gene 32 promoter was transcribed from an identical start site in a range of Gram-negative bacteria, including Paracoccus denitrificans (Frey et al., 1988),337 suggesting a common mechanism of \\(\\sigma^{70}\\) recognition. In the case of the nirS gene it might be expected that the RNA polymerase binding sites differ from those normally found in \\(\\sigma^{70}\\) dependent genes as the NNR-binding site overlays the -35 region and the NNR protein contains a putative site for interaction with RNA polymerase (de Boer, 1996).168 However, due to the lack of an obvious -10 site in the nirS gene it is concluded that transcription of the nirS gene is probably independent of \\(\\sigma^{70}\\). A less likely possibility is that the specificity of the T. pantotropha \\(\\sigma^{70}\\) subunit differs from that of the E. coli \\(\\sigma^{70}\\) and can bind to a much weaker -10 consensus, particularly when binding is enhanced by the NNR protein. Experiments in Ps. aeruginosa using the ANR and FNR proteins indicated that the Ps. aeruginosa \\(\\sigma^{70}\\)- dependent RNA polymerase may have different specificity from that of the E. coli enzyme (Winteler and Haas, 1996)203 and in vitro data also suggested that the purified polymerase may be less stringent (Gao and Gussin, 1991).338 An alternative -10/-35 promoter consensus sequence was proposed by Steinrücke and Ludwig (1993),257 based on the analysis of several genes from P. denitrificans and closely- related species. This consensus was TTCGGN-N\\(_{16-20}\\)-GATNGG/C. A match to this, with four of the six positions filled in each hexamer can be discerned in the nirS upstream sequence if it is assumed that as in E. coli the -10 site is allowed to fall anywhere in the first hexamer. However, this consensus is now thought unlikely to be accurate as very little of the data was based on experimentally determined transcription start sites for P. denitrificans genes. Furthermore, genes that encoded proteins from a range of metabolic activities were included in the analysis, with little consideration of whether the genes were expressed constitutively or under specific conditions. The last point is very important as in order to analyse the transcription of the nirS gene in a meaningful manner, it should really be compared with the transcription of other NNR-dependent (or possibly FNR-dependent) genes from P. denitrificans or its close relatives. Unfortunately no information concerning transcripts from the nir or nor genes in P. denitrificans is available apart from that reported in this chapter, as most work in the area has been carried out using Ps. stutzeri Zobell. However, it was possible to examine the sequences of the NNR-dependent genes nirS and norCB from P. denitrificans and T. pantotropha by aligning the NNR-binding sites of these sequences and looking for common features lying between the NNR-binding site and the ATG start codon (Figure 7.12). Figure 7.12: Alignments of the upstream regions of NNR-regulated genes from P. denitrificans and T. pantotropha showing regions of conserved sequence. Group 1 shows genes with the consensus hexamer TTGCGC in the upstream region. The nirI gene is assumed to be regulated by NNR (see text for details). Also included are the non-NNR-regulated genes nirE and nnr. Group 2 shows a consensus resembling the RpoN binding site in the nirI and nnr upstream regions. The NNR binding site is shown in bold, the ATG start codon is in bold-italic. In Group 1 the TTGCGC hexamer is underlined, in Group 2 residues matching the RpoN consensus are underlined. +1 indicates the transcription start site of the nirS gene. A perfect 10 bp inverted repeat in the nirS gene is indicated by inward-facing arrows. Sequence data for P. denitrificans PD1222 and P. denitrificans 12442 was taken from GenBank accession number U05002 and Ohshima et. al. (1993),140 respectively. The nirI genes from these organisms were also included in this analysis as they may be regulated by NNR (see below). Several regions of homology between some or all of the sequences are apparent from this alignment. First, the nirS genes contain a perfect inverted repeat of 10 bp which begins five base pairs after the last nucleotide of the NNR-binding site. These repeats were noted during the sequencing of the nirS gene described in Chapter 3. Less well-defined repeats can be discerned in some of the other sequences, but the repeats in the nirS sequences stand out because they are perfect and because of a striking structural conservation; the first and last dinucleotides in the repeat from the T. pantotropha sequence are TT and AA respectively whereas those in the two sequences from the P. denitrificans nirS genes are GG and CC. Thus although the sequences differ, a perfect repeat is conserved in each case. This feature suggests a structural role for the repeat. A possible role is in the binding of a transcriptional repressor protein which would serve to prevent transcription of the nirS gene under non-denitrifying conditions. Repeats of similar size and structure that serve to bind repressors are common to many prokaryotic genes (e.g. Schmitt and Holmes, 1994).339 The second striking feature in the upstream sequences is the presence of a hexanucleotide with the sequence TTGCGC in the nirI and two of the nirS sequences. Similar sequences are seen in the T. pantotropha nirS gene sequence (TTCCGC), the norCB sequence (TTGCCG) and in two sequences that are apparently not regulated by NNR: nirE (TTCGCG) and the nnr gene itself (TTGCGC). In the case of the T. pantotropha nirS gene the hexanucleotide is centred at -16.5 relative to the transcription start site. This sequence lies in a similar position relative to the NNR box in all of the NNR-regulated genes and the conservation in terms of sequence and position strongly suggests a role for this region of sequence. Closer examination of the region that includes the TTGCGC hexanucleotide reveals some similarity to a family of promoters that are dependent on an alternative sigma factor, designated variously as \\(\\sigma^{54}\\), NtrA or RpoN. RpoN-dependent promoters were first identified in genes involved in nitrogen fixation (Beynon et al., 1983)340 and have since been identified in several organisms where they regulate a diverse range of functions (Römermann et al., 1989).341 RpoN differs from the better-known \\(\\sigma^{70}\\)-dependent RNA polymerase in that it requires an ATP-binding activator protein in order to initiate transcription from an open promoter-polymerase complex (Kustu et al., 1989).342 Additionally, the consensus sequence that is recognised by RpoN differs from the -35/-10 \\(\\sigma^{70}\\) sequences found in E. coli (Figure 7.12). The minimum requirement for an RpoN-dependent promoter is a GC dinucleotide found 11-14 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site (most often found at the -12 position) and an invariant GG dinucleotide 10 bp further upstream. most often at the -24 position (Thöny and Hennecke, 1989).343 In Figure 7.12 it can be seen that the regions upstream of nirI and nnr contain these dinucleotides with the correct spacing relative to each other and some additional sequence conservation at other residues. However, the nirS, nirE and norCB genes lack one of the guanine residues in the invariant GG dinucleotide. Additionally, the GC dinucleotide begins at the -17 position in the nirS genes which is rather far from the more normal -12 position. It therefore seems unlikely that the sigma factor involved in transcription of the denitrification genes is the RpoN protein. However, it is still plausible that a similar type of protein might be involved. Putative RpoN binding sites have been identified in the upstream regions of some genes involved in denitrification, including the Ps. stutzeri Zobell nosZ gene (Cuypers and Zumft, 1992)344 and the nnrR gene of R. sphaeroides 2.43 (Tosques et al., 1996).202 The effects on denitrification of knocking out the rpon gene in these organisms have yet to be investigated, although it is known that disruption of the rpoN gene in Ps. aeruginosa has no effect on denitrification (Totten et al., 1990).345 In contrast, disruption of the rpoN (formerly hno) gene in Alcaligenes eutrophus exerts a wide-ranging pleiotropic effect including the loss of denitrification (Roemermann et al., 1988).346 Although rpoN disruption in Ps. aeruginosa had no effect on denitrification, it is known that there are promoters in this organism which resemble RpoN-dependent promoters, in that they possess the GG-N\\(_{10}\\)-GC motif but the GC dinucleotide is upstream of the normal -12 position and the genes are fully functional in the absence of RpoN. Intriguingly, one such gene is that which encodes the ENR homologue ANR in Ps. aeruginosa (Savioz et al., 1993)347 and it has been suggested that these “RpoN-like” promoter regions depend on an alternative sigma factor. In Bradyrhizobium japonicum, an organism quite closely related to T. pantotropha there are two rpoN genes encoding the proteins RpoN, and RpoN2, with distinct specificities (Kullik et al., 1991).348 It is tempting to speculate that this is also the case in T. pantotropha and P. denitrificans and that one of the RpoN homologues would be involved in denitrification. Whatever the identity of the sigma factor involved in transcription of denitrifying genes, a model for its interaction with the promoter and with other regulatory components would be extremely valuable. At present genes encoding four types of regulatory protein have been identified in the denitrification gene clusters of the principal denitrifying organisms. The properties of these proteins are summarised in Table 7.1. Table 7.1: Proteins involved in regulating the expression of denitrification enzymes in P. denitrificans Regulatory protein Cellular location and putative features Comments and references FnrP Cytoplasmic. N-terminal iron-sulphur cluster, RNA polymerase contact site, dimerisation domain, helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif. P. denitrificans homologue of the E. coli FNR protein.

Similar to FnrP, but lacks N-terminal cysteine residues involved in binding iron-sulphur cluster. Homologue of FNR, specifically regulates transcription of nitrite and nitric oxide reductases (van Spanning et al. 1995).195 NosR Membrane-bound. Iron-sulphur cluster. Helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif. Identified in P. denitrificans but not characterised (Hoeren et al. 1993).96 Homologue in Ps. stutzeri regulates transcription of nitrous oxide reductase (Cuypers et al. 1992).172 NirI Membrane-bound. Iron-sulphur cluster. Less clear helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif than NosR. Homologue of NosR, but not well characterised. Regulates transcription of nitrite reductase (de Boer et al. 1994).141 NorQ Cytoplasmic. Nucleotide-binding motif. Less clear DNA-binding motif than NirQ. Identified in P. denitrificans but not well characterised. Mutants have reduced levels of nitrite and nitric oxide reductases (de Boer et al. 1996).171 Ps. stutzeri homologue, NirQ, resembles NtrC family of transcriptional activators, mutants have reduced nitrite and nitric oxide reductase activity but similar level of the proteins (Jüngst and Zumft 1992).170 Four of these regulatory proteins (FnrP, NNR, NosR and Nirl) are known to be involved with the transcription of one or more denitrification genes. NosR mutants in Ps. stutzeri fail to synthesise nitrous oxide reductase (Cuypers et al., 1992),172 whilst NNR mutants in P. denitrificans fail to synthesise the nitrite and nitric oxide reductases (van Spanning et al., 1995).195 FNR and its close homologues appear to regulate the synthesis of nitrate and nitrous oxide reductases, as well as a number of other genes that are induced under microaerobic conditions (van Spanning et al., 1997).193 The NirQ protein of Ps. stutzeri seems to be related to the NtrC family of transcriptional regulators (Kustu et al., 1989)342 in that it contains a nucleotide binding site and a DNA-binding helix-turn-helix motif, but disruption of the nirQ gene gives rise to a mutant in which nitrite and nitric oxide reductases are present at normal or slightly elevated levels but are not active (Jüngst and Zumft, 1992).170 This suggests some role for NirQ in the modulation of the enzyme activity of these two reductases. The situation is different again for the NirQ homologue found in P. denitrificans, NorQ; disruption of this gene substantially reduces the levels of nitrite and nitric oxide reductases (de Boer et al., 1996).171 This may be due to its differing location in the gene cluster; in P. denitrificans norQ lies amongst the structural genes for nitric oxide reductase (de Boer et al., 1996)171 whereas in Ps. stutzeri it is transcribed divergently upstream of the nirS gene (Jüngst and Zumft, 1992).170 In P. denitrificans NirI and NNR are the only proteins so far identified as having a role in transcription of the nirS gene and an understanding of their action is far from complete. NirI is predicted to be an integral inner membrane protein with seven transmembrane helices and a putative iron-sulphur cluster (de Boer, 1996).168 The latter feature may bind a signal molecule, perhaps as part of a redox-sensing pathway. Although its homologue NosR in Ps. stutzeri contains a putative DNA-binding helix-turn-helix motif (Cuypers et al., 1992)172 it is difficult to conceive of a membrane-bound protein acting directly as a transcriptional activator, although such a role has also been suggested for the E. coli FecI protein which is involved in iron dicitrate transport (van Hove et al., 1990)349 and for the ToxR protein of Vibrio cholerae, which activates the transcription of cholera toxin (Miller et al., 1987).350 Therefore, NirI may be a transcriptional activator or it may be linked to a second as yet unidentified protein which activates transcription from the nirS promoter, in a similar fashion to the two component regulators such as the NarX-NarL system (Nohno et al., 1989).39 As the NNR protein probably binds to the nirS NNR-box (although this has not been demonstrated experimentally) an interaction between NirI and NNR cannot be ruled out. If NirI is involved in transcriptional activation of the nirS gene the role of the NNR box upstream of the nirS gene needs to be clarified. The nirI gene itself could be under the control of NNR as shown in Figure 7.13; due to the palindromic nature of the NNR-binding site the nirS NNR-box could function on the opposite DNA strand to regulate the expression of the divergently-transcribed nirI gene. Figure 7.13: Putative factors influencing the transcription of nitrite and nitric oxide reductases in T. pantotropha. In this diagram the Nnr protein is assumed to be a transcriptional activator for the nirS, nirI and norCB genes. The factor(s) that activate transcription of the nnr gene are unknown. NirI also activates transcription of the nirS gene, possibly through an as-yet unidentified cytoplasmic protein. RpoD represents an alternative sigma factor involved in transcription of the denitrification genes; it may not be the same protein in all cases. The circle labelled ‘R’ indicates an as-yet unidentified repressor protein that binds upstream of the nirS gene. The NorQ protein is thought to modulate the activities of the nitrite and nitric oxide reductases; its mode of action is not known. More details are given in the text.

The alignment in Figure 7.12 shows a number of conserved residues in the upstream regions of the nirI and nirS genes suggesting that this is probably the case and strengthening the argument for an interaction between NNR and NirI. Experiments in R. sphaeroides 2.4.3 have shown that the nnrR gene is expressed constitutively at a low level throughout growth and indicate that the Nnr protein is activated by an effector, which has been suggested to be nitric oxide. The initial NO signal would be generated from a low level constitutive activity of the nitrite reductase (Tosques et al., 1996).202 In T. pantotropha this is an attractive proposition for two reasons: first, NNR seems to regulate specifically the nitrite and nitric oxide reductases which are involved with the production and consumption of nitric oxide and second, these reductases probably only function at very low oxygen concentrations. As nitric oxide is highly reactive with oxygen, it would be diverted away from bioenergetically-useful reduction by nitric oxide reductase at high oxygen tensions (Tosques et al., 1996).202 NirI and NNR might, therefore, function together as a sensor of redox state or of nitric oxide concentration at lower oxygen concentrations than FNR, to co-ordinate the expression of the nitrite and nitric oxide reductases. Two important experiments would clarify the respective roles of NirI and NNR: determination of whether NirI is expressed in an nnr mutant strain and conversely, whether nnr and norCB which are NNR-dependent are expressed in a nirI mutant. It is clear that much remains to be learned about the mechanisms of regulation during denitrification in P. denitrificans, T. pantotropha and other micro-organisms. It is very likely that further components of the regulatory pathway remain to be discovered and the role of other environmental factors, such as N-oxides remains to be elucidated. For example, it is known that nitrate and nitrite can influence the expression of denitrification genes, most probably through a system similar to the NarX-NarL system of E. coli, although these genes have not yet been discovered in any denitrifying bacterium. In terms of the transcription of the nirS gene in T. pantotropha, a number of future experiments can be suggested. First, it needs to be demonstrated that the nirS and nirE genes each have their own promoter as suggested by the Northern blotting experiments. This should be achieved quite soon using transcriptional or translational fusions with reporter genes downstream of the putative promoter regions. The roles of individual residues in the promoter region can then be investigated further, initially by deletions of whole parts of these regions and ultimately using site-directed mutagenesis. The nature of the RNA polymerase also needs to be elucidated; the T. pantotropha genome should be probed for the presence of one or more copies of an RpoN-like gene and disruption of the gene(s) carried out to determine if this sigma factor is involved in denitrification. Whatever the sigma factor proves to be, the ultimate proof of its function will be to show that in conjunction with NNR it drives transcription in vitro from the nirS promoter. DNA protection studies of the promoter region using NNR and RNA polymerase will eventually show directly the location of the RNA polymerase contact sites and may allow the definition of a consensus binding site for the RNA polymerase.

The ultimate goal of this work, which is beyond the scope of the present project, is to construct a number of site-directed mutants of cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) in which the key residues, such as the haem ligands and the histidines at the active site, are altered. This would allow the role of these residues to be more clearly defined. In Chapter 3, the sequence of the nirS gene and its product, cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) was reported. Knowledge of the cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) protein sequence has allowed the crystal structure to be refined to 1.28 Å and has confirmed the haem ligands in the oxidised form (His-17 and His-69 at the c-haem, Tyr-25 and His-200 at the d\\(_1\\) haem). The sequence also confirms that eight N-terminal residues are not visible in the crystal structure because of disorder in the crystal packing. The major finding in Chapter 3 was that the haem ligands His-17 and Tyr-25 are not conserved in the cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) family. This was a surprising finding in view of the overall high similarity of the protein sequences and some implications for the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme were discussed. It was noted that structural data for cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) from other organisms would be a valuable addition to the current data. Very recently, the structure of cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) in the oxidised state from Ps. aeruginosa has been solved.351 Although the structure itself has not yet been published, some of the details have been made available. The c-haem is ligated by a methionine and a histidine residue, as was predicted from MCD spectroscopy for cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) both from Ps. aeruginosa124 and from Ps. stutzeri Zobell.125 The d\\(_1\\) haem is ligated by histidine and by a hydroxide ion. Interestingly, Ps. aeruginosa cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) is the only other example, apart from that of T. pantotropha cytochrome cd\\(_1\\), of a cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) with a tyrosine residue close to the N-terminus of the protein. In the case of Ps. aeruginosa this tyrosine, Tyr-10, does not act directly as a ligand to the d\\(_1\\) haem, but is instead hydrogen-bonded to the hydroxide ion which in turn is the sixth ligand to the d\\(_1\\) haem. Furthermore, replacement of Tyr-10 with phenylalanine has no effect on the catalytic activity, optical spectroscopy or electron transfer kinetics of Ps. aeruginosa cytochrome cd\\(_1\\).351 These data strengthen the case for significant structural and mechanistic differences between the cytochromes cd\\(_1\\), but also emphasise the importance of assessing the role of Tyr-25 in the T. pantotropha enzyme using as many approaches as possible. Chapters 4 to 6 of the present work were concerned with the expression of the cloned nirS gene in different systems. In Chapter 4 it was shown that the T. pantotropha nirS gene could be expressed in E. coli to give a semi-apo protein containing only c-type haem. It was then possible to reconstitute the recombinant protein with purified d\\(_1\\) haem, producing a protein with some of the spectroscopic and catalytic features of the native enzyme. This approach will be of use in the production of site-directed mutants that are structurally unstable or enzymically inactive when expressed as the holoprotein. Such mutants would not support the growth of the host organism under denitrifying conditions and so little or no protein could be recovered for further studies. However, provided that the semi-apo form of the mutant protein was stably maintained in E. coli, it should be possible to reconstitute the recombinant protein as described. Future work in this area will require improvements in the yield of recombinant protein and the optimisation of the reconstitution protocol. Chapter 5 described the expression of the T. pantotropha nirS gene in Ps. aeruginosa. In this case, it was hoped that the recombinant protein would be able to sequestrate the d\\(_1\\) haem that was synthesised by the host organism, so as to yield the active holoenzyme. However, some difficulties were experienced both with the solubility of the recombinant enzyme during anaerobic growth and with the DNA construct used. It appeared that the presence of either the regulatory region upstream of the cloned nirS gene or that of the truncated downstream nirE gene had an adverse effect on the growth of the host cells. In future work using any heterologous host organism, a DNA construct containing only the structural gene, nirS, is recommended. Nevertheless, recombinant cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) with some of the spectroscopic and catalytic properties of the native enzyme was produced, and this system could be of use for identifying mutants of cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) in which enzymatic activity has been completely abolished. Chapter 6 detailed the construction of a nirS deletion mutant in T. pantotropha and its use as a host for expression of the cloned nirS gene. It was shown that the mutant could be complemented with the wild-type gene on a low copy number plasmid, fully restoring anaerobic growth on nitrate with no deleterious effects. However, expression of a cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) mutant in which the d\\(_1\\) haem ligand, Tyr-25, was replaced with phenylalanine did not restore growth to the deletion mutant strain; furthermore, the amount of expressed enzyme was extremely low, indicating that it may have been degraded. These data indicate that Tyr-25 is an essential residue for the function of T. pantotropha cytochrome cd\\(_1\\), although strictly, as the recombinant protein could not be isolated, it was not possible to determine whether Tyr-25 is essential for catalytic activity. However, this interpretation of the data is very plausible; it may be that as the cells are incapable of nitrite reduction, they are placed under stress because of the accumulation of nitrite and the inactive cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) is degraded as part of a general stress response. The presence of elevated levels of pseudoazurin, cytochrome c peroxidase and a previously unidentified c-type cytochrome may also all be indications of a stress response. These data illustrate the problem of expressing a cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) mutant that cannot support the growth of the host organism under denitrifying conditions. Possible solutions to this problem may include (1) the co-expression of a copper nitrite reductase in the deletion mutant strain, which would allow denitrifying growth and also the isolation of the mutant cytochrome cd\\(_1\\), and (2) investigation of the expression of cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) mutants under different growth conditions. So far is as known, the genes for d\\(_1\\) biosynthesis, as well as the nirS gene, are activated during anaerobic, denitrifying growth, but further understanding of the regulation of denitrification may reveal a way in which aerobic expression of these genes can be achieved. Finally, in Chapter 7, the transcription of the nirS gene was explored. It was shown that the nirS gene was transcribed as a monocistronic mRNA. The transcription start site of the gene was also identified. The former result was of some importance, as it established that the nirS deletion described in Chapter 6 could be constructed without disruption of the d\\(_1\\) biosynthesis genes situated downstream of the nirS gene. Additionally, an analysis of some of the denitrification gene sequences that are currently known indicates a common regulatory mechanism and strongly suggests that these genes are transcribed using a specific sigma factor. However, it is abundantly clear that at present, very little is understood of the transcriptional regulation of denitrification genes, and a number of future experiments in this direction were proposed at the end of Chapter 7. Elucidating the regulation and function of the many denitrification genes that have been identified looks certain to be the major challenge in the field of denitrification research in future years.

The propeller structure consists of an eightfold repeat of a four-stranded antiparallel \\(\\beta\\)-sheet motif and is so named because each set of four strands is arranged in a circular domain, resembling a propeller with eight blades. A schematic diagram of this domain is shown in Figure A1. Figure A.1: Schematic diagram of the \\(\\beta\\)-propeller d\\(_1\\)-haem binding domain of T. pantotropha cytochrome cd\\(_1\\). The symbol H represents histidine residues; on blade 1, His-200, blade 4, His-345 and blade 5, His-388. The “Velcro” closure of the ring is indicated by six parallel lines between the 2 \\(\\beta\\)-strands of blade 8, each line representing a hydrogen bond. The lollipop symbol represents conserved aspartate residues at the end of strand 3 within each blade. The sheets are packed face to face, providing structural stability via mainly hydrophobic interaction between them. The rigidity of the propeller structure is also maintained by interactions that act to close (or “Velcro”) the propeller ring. In cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) this is achieved by forming the last blade (conventionally assigned as the blade where closure occurs) from both termini of the propeller domain; the C-terminal innermost strand of blade 8 bonds via six main chain hydrogen bonds to one of the other three antiparallel sheets which are provided by the N-terminus. Propeller structures are being found in an increasing number of proteins, from both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) provides only the second example of an eight bladed propeller, the other being that of the heavy subunit of methanol dehydrogenase, the structure of which has been determined from Methylobacterium extorquens (Ghosh et al., 1995)352 and Methylophilus methylotrophus W3A1 (Xia et al., 1996).353 Other propeller structures are known with seven blades (fungal galactose oxidase from Dactylium dendroides (Ito et al., 1991),354 methylamine dehydrogenase from P. denitrificans (Vellieux et 1989,152 and eukaryotic G-protein \\(\\beta\\)-subunit, Sondek et al., 1996),355 six blades (influenza neuraminidase, Varghese et al., 1983,153 and bacterial sialidase, Gaskell et al., 1995)356 and four blades (hemopexin, Faber et al., 1995,357 and collagenase, Li et al., 1995).358 All propeller domains contain a central tunnel, preserved by the rigidity of the structure, which is used toco-ordinate a ligand or prosthetic group involved in catalysis or some other protein function. In the case of cytochrome cd\\(_1\\), the channel is filled by the d\\(_1\\) haem, which makes a large number of contacts with protein side chains and solvating water molecules lining the channel. The emergence of several \\(\\beta\\)-propeller structures prompted us to ask whether the cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) crystal structure and sequence indicates any determinants that could account for such structures. This work was mostly carried out by Drs. Vilmos Fülöp and Simon Baker, but it results from analysis of the cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) sequence reported in Chapter 3 and is published in a joint paper (Baker et al., 1997b),262 and so it is described here in some detail. Direct sequence comparison of cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) to methanol dehydrogenase, the other example of an eight-bladed propeller protein, reveals no significant homology. Despite this, the d\\(_1\\) haem binding domain can be very closely superimposed onto the eight-bladed propeller of methanol dehydrogenase, using the program STAMP (Russell and Barton, 1992),359 an alignment program for 3-D structures, rather than primary sequences. Essentially the same propeller can therefore be achieved with two different sequences, though in MDH ring closure is achieved differently; the last blade is formed from three C-terminal antiparallel sheets and an outermost sheet from the N-terminus. This feature is also seen in the other seven and six-bladed propeller structures. Visual inspection of the cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) protein sequence reveals that the third sheet of each blade almost always ends with an aspartate residue (residues 183, 224, 272, 326, 370, 474 and 535, with Asp 420 displaced two residues from the C-terminal end of blade 5, sheet 3), as shown in Figure 3.13. These residues are predominantly exposed to the solvent and seven of the eight are superimposable on each other when the third sheets from each blade are aligned. Methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) is one of a family of bacterial dehydrogenases termed the PQQ-binding proteins (after the pyrolloquinoline quinone cofactor that they possess), which includes low specificity alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH) and periplasmic glucose dehydrogenases (GDH). Alignment of 15 sequences from this family to M. extorquens MDH gives 23-98% identity, suggesting a common fold in the PQQ-binding domain; it has been suggested previously (Cozier et al., 1995)360 that the \\(\\alpha\\)-subunit of ADH from Acetobacter aceti will possess an MDH-like eight-bladed \\(\\beta\\)-propeller domain. The STAMP program was used to overlay the structural primary sequence alignment of the MDH and cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) \\(\\beta\\)-propeller domains onto the 15 PQQ-binding protein sequences. This allowed the prediction of the positions of seven of the eight blades in these sequences (the eighth is harder to predict due to the differing method of ring closure described previously). The alignment revealed terminal \\(\\beta\\)-sheet aspartate residues in four out of eight blades in the MDH sequences, at identical positions to those in cytochrome cd\\(_1\\). Of the 105 predicted propeller blades (seven blades in the 15 sequences), 60 contained a terminal \\(\\beta\\)-sheet aspartate residue, preceded by hydrophobic amino acids. In contrast, 37 of the predicted blades contained a previously identified feature named the “tryptophan docking motif” (Ghosh et al., 1995).352 This feature was first noted in methanol dehydrogenase and consists of a stabilising stacking interaction between the indole ring of a tryptophan residue on one propeller blade and a glycine residue on an adjacent blade. The feature is entirely absent from cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) and cannot therefore be essential for propeller stability. The weak consensus derived from common residues in all the blades of the d\\(_1\\) haem domain was also used to search for possible propeller structures in the protein sequence databases with less success. It is concluded that the terminal aspartate motif plays a common role in cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) and the PQQ-binding proteins, but at present this role is unclear. The aspartates are exposed to the solvent and a role in structural integrity seems unlikely; they may be involved in the pathway of folding in the periplasm. Although there seem to be relationships between the PQQ-binding proteins and the 8 bladed propeller of cytochrome cd\\(_1\\), these cannot be related to a number of other features in known propeller structures. In addition to the aforementioned tryptophan docking motif, tryptophan residues are also involved in a large family of proteins called the “WD repeat” family, which includes the \\(\\beta\\)-subunit of the eukaryotic G-proteins (Garcia-Higuera et al., 1996).361 In these propeller structures, long repeats are found that terminate with the residues Trp-Asp, at the end of the third strand in each blade. The Trp residue is buried between sheets and interacts with an Asp-His-Ser/Thr triad, whilst the Asp residue stabilises the loop between the third and fourth strands of a blade by a number of hydrogen bonds. Again, this is very different to any structural motif found in cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) or other propeller proteins, although Sondek et al. (1996)355 have noted a weak sequence similarity between the WD-repeat proteins and some of the more strongly conserved repeats in fungal galactose oxidase. However, the third strand of each blade does terminate with Asp in the WD repeat proteins. The six-bladed propeller protein bacterial sialidase contains a consensus repeat sequence Ser/Thr-Xaa-Asp-[Xaa]\\(_n\\)-Gly-Xaa-Thr-Trp/Phe, termed the “Asp box” (Gaskell et al., 1995).356 This appears to dictate the fold and integrity of the propeller and again, the Asp residue falls near the end of strand 3 in each \\(\\beta\\)-sheet. However, the Asp box is not present in cytochrome cd\\(_1\\). A final type of motif, known as Drosophila kelch, has been identified in mouse MIPP protein, poxvirus and fungal galactose oxidase (Bork and Doolittle, 1994),362 where one motif is found in each of the seven blades. This does not contain the Asp residue prevalent in the other motifs and cannot be used to describe cytochrome cd\\(_1\\). Finally, the four-bladed propeller structures (hemopexin and collagenase) are quite differently arranged to the other examples, in that adjacent strands in a sheet are perpendicular and not stacked on one another. Stabilisation in these structures is brought about by a calcium ion and a disulphide bond between the first and last blades. These features are not relevant to cytochrome cd\\(_1\\). In summary, although the propeller domain is a common feature to several proteins, the fold seems to be achieved in a number of different ways which are not dictated by sequence features common to all the proteins. Aspartate residues in cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) and a number of other proteins, particularly the PQQ-binding proteins, seem to be important in some as yet unknown way, but are not necessarily involved with the integrity of folding and do not form a clear basis for prediction of the fold from protein sequence alone. Each group of propeller proteins (cytochrome cd\\(_1\\) type, PQQ-type, WD repeat-type, Asp-box-type and kelch-type) possesses some conserved residues. However, given the wide distribution of propeller proteins, with no fundamental common sequence features even at a low level, the model of propeller formation by divergent evolution proposed by Bork and Doolittle (1994)362 seems less likely. Murzin (1992)363 suggests that propeller formation is merely a variation on the packing of \\(\\beta\\)-sheets which can be extended from a consideration of the geometry that defines an ordinary \\(\\beta\\)-sandwich protein and does not require any special sequence constraints. The analysis presented here seems to support this idea. References "],["B-classification-of-t-pantotropha.html", "B Classification of T. pantotropha", " B Classification of T. pantotropha Throughout the present work the principal organism under study has been referred to by the name Thiosphaera pantotropha. However, during the course of the project the taxonomic position of this organism has come under scrutiny by a number of workers. In particular, it has been suggested that the organism should be re-classified as Paracoccus denitrificans (Ludwig et al., 1993).364 This argument was based on two observations: first, the 16S rRNA sequence of T. pantotropha is identical to that of P. denitrificans strain LMG 4218 and second, 100% DNA homology is observed between these two organisms in hybridisation experiments. Additionally, some of the metabolic differences that originally distinguished T. pantotropha from P. denitrificans (Robertson and Kuenen, 1983),223 particularly aerobic denitrification, appear to have become attenuated since the original isolation of T. pantotropha. However, recent work has shown that there is some confusion as to the history of various strains of P. denitrificans which are deposited in several culture collections around the world. The relationship between strains of P. denitrificans has been re-investigated by examining the c-type cytochrome profiles using SDS-PAGE and by analysis of the protein sequences of cytochrome c\\(_{550}\\) from each strain (Goodhew et al., 1996).236 The analysis indicates that P. denitrificans LMG 4218 is closely related to T. pantotropha, but also that P. denitrificans LMG 4218 is not derived from the original type strain of P. denitrificans (Beijerinck and Minkman, 1910),365 as was thought previously. Instead, P. denitrificans LMG 4218 is placed in a group that includes a later strain of P. denitrificans, P. denitrificans LMD 52.44. The revised grouping of the strains would affect the way in which they were sub-divided, were consideration to be given to the creation of separate species within the genus Paracoccus. To address the latter question, fatty acid methyl ester analysis (FAMES) has been used (Thompson et al., 1997).222 This technique uses gas chromatography to analyse the relative amounts of different fatty acids in the cell membranes of bacteria. Taxonomic classification based on these measurements has been used successfully (Rainey et al., 1994)366 and the method is particularly well-suited to the grouping of strains at the sub-species level (Thompson et al., 1993).367 The results are so far unpublished, but they broadly support the assertion that P. denitrificans LMD 52.44, P. denitrificans LMG 4218 and T. pantotropha form a separate group within the genus Paracoccus, and also correlate well with a recent analysis of 16S rRNA sequences which suggested that the organism Thiobacillus versutus should be transferred to Paracoccus versutus (Katayama et al., 1995).368 Although all of the P. denitrificans strains studied were very similar in many respects, Thompson et al. (1997)222 assert that there is sufficient variation within the genus to propose the creation of separate species names, and it is suggested that T. pantotropha be renamed P. pantotrophus, to reflect the findings and to promote continuity of the pantotrophus species name. The taxonomic status of T. pantotropha therefore remains undecided, although some workers have recently adopted its transfer to P. denitrificans, based on the work of Ludwig et al. (1993).364 However, in the present work the name T. pantotropha has been retained, to avoid confusion between previous work in which this name was used and the much larger body of literature that refers specifically to P. denitrificans.

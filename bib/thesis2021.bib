	abstract = {The oriT site of the broad host-range multicopy IncQ plasmid RSF1010 was cloned onto the 2.2 kb pBR322-derived vector pED825. By successive subcloning and construction of deletions, the oriT region was localised on an 80-88 bp segment of DNA. This segment was contained within the HaeII fragment of RSF1010 that is known to include the relaxation nick site. The oriT region was sequenced and inverted repeats and sequences homologous to the oriT regions of ColE1 and RK2 were identified. A striking 10 bp inverted repeat at one end of the 88 bp oriT segment may be important for recognition of oriT, and its possible role in transfer is discussed. As for other plasmids, the oriT region served as the site for recA-independent, transfer-dependent, site-specific recombination. This provides genetic evidence that strand breakage and re-joining occur at oriT during transfer. Mobilization was independent of transcription by RNA polymerase in the donor cell, as shown by the lack of effect of rifampicin. Inversion of the oriT site with respect to the plasmid oriV site showed that there was no functional dependence of oriT on oriV for synthesis of primers possibly involved in recipient conjugal DNA synthesis. Alternative mechanisms are discussed.},

	abstract = {narK mutants of Escherichia coli produce wild-type levels of nitrate reductase but, unlike the wild-type strain, do not accumulate nitrite when grown anaerobically on a glucose-nitrate medium. Comparison of the rates of nitrate and nitrite metabolism in cultures growing anaerobically on glucose-nitrate medium revealed that a narK mutant reduced nitrate at a rate only slightly slower than that in the NarK+ parental strain. Although the specific activities of nitrate reductase and nitrite reductase were similar in the two strains, the parental strain accumulated nitrite in the medium in almost stoichiometric amounts before it was further reduced, while the narK mutant did not accumulate nitrite in the medium but apparently reduced it as rapidly as it was formed. Under conditions in which nitrite reductase was not produced, the narK mutant excreted the nitrite formed from nitrate into the medium; however, the rate of reduction of nitrate to nitrite was significantly slower than that of the parental strain or that which occurred when nitrite reductase was present. These results demonstrate that E. coli is capable of taking up nitrate and excreting nitrite in the absence of a functional NarK protein; however, in growing cells, a functional NarK promotes a more rapid rate of anaerobic nitrate reduction and the continuous excretion of the nitrite formed. Based on the kinetics of nitrate reduction and of nitrite reduction and excretion in growing cultures and in washed cell suspensions, it is proposed that the narK gene encodes a nitrate/nitrite antiporter which facilitates anaerobic nitrate respiration by coupling the excretion of nitrite to nitrate uptake. The failure of nitrate to suppress the reduction of trimethylamine N-oxide in narK mutants was not due to a change in the level of trimethylamine N-oxide reductase but apparently resulted from a relative decrease in the rate of anaerobic nitrate reduction caused by the loss of the antiporter system.},

These hybrid promoters, tacI and tacII, were derived from sequences of the trp and the lac UV5 promoters. In the first hybrid promoter (tacI), the DNA upstream of position -20 with respect to the transcriptional start site was derived from the trp promoter. The DNA downstream of position -20 was derived from the lac UV5 promoter. In the second hybrid promoter (tacII), the DNA upstream of position -11 at the Hpa I site within the Pribnow box was derived from the trp promoter. The DNA downstream of position -11 is a 46-base-pair synthetic DNA fragment that specifies part of the hybrid Pribnow box and the entire lac operator. It also specifies a Shine-Dalgarno sequence flanked by two unique restriction sites (portable Shine-Dalgarno sequence). The tacI and the tacII promoters respectively direct transcription approximately 11 and 7 times more efficiently than the derepressed parental lac UV5 promoter and approximately 3 and 2 times more efficiently than the trp promoter in the absence of the trp repressor. Both hybrid promoters can be repressed by the lac repressor and both can be derepressed with isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactoside. Consequently, these hybrid promoters are useful for the controlled expression of foreign genes at high levels in E. coli. In contrast to the trp and the lac UV5 promoters, the tacI promoter has not only a consensus -35 sequence but also a consensus Pribnow box sequence. This may explain the higher efficiency of this hybrid promoter with respect to either one of the parental promoters.},

This gene, nirS, codes for a mature protein of 63144 Da having high homology with cd1-type nitrite reductases from other bacteria. Directly downstream from nirS, three other nir genes were found in the order nirECF. The organization of the nir gene cluster in Pa. denitrificans is different from the organization of nir clusters in some Pseudomonads. nirE has high homology with a S-adenosyl-L-methionine:uroporphyrinogen III methyltransferase (uro'gen III methylase). This methylase is most likely involved in the heme d1 biosynthesis in Pa. denitrificans. The third gene, nirC, codes for a small cytochrome c of 9.3 kDa having high homology with cytochrome c55X of Ps. stutzeri ZoBell. The 4th gene, nirF, has no homology with other genes in the sequence databases and has no relevant motifs. Inactivation of either of these 4 genes resulted in the loss of nitrite and nitric oxide reductase activities but not of nitrous oxide reductase activity. nirS mutants lack the cd1-type nitrite reductase while nirE, nirC and nirF mutants produce a small amount of cd1-type nitrite reductase, inactive due to the absence of heme d1. Upstream from the nirS gene the start of a gene was identified which has limited homology with nosR, a putative regulatory gene involved in nitrous oxide reduction. A potential FNR box was identified between this gene and nirS.},

Mutagenesis of norC, norB, norQ and norD resulted in cells unable to grow anaerobically. Nitrite reductase and NO reductase (with succinate or ascorbate as substrates) and nitrous oxide reductase (with succinate as substrate) activities were not detected in these mutant strains. Nitrite extrusion was detected in the medium, indicating that nitrate reductase was active. The norQ and norD mutant strains retained about 16\% and 23\% of the wild-type level of NorC, respectively. The norE and norF mutant strains had specific growth rates and NorC contents similar to those of the wild-type strain, but had reduced NOR and NIR activities, indicating that their gene products are involved in regulation of enzyme activity.

	abstract = {The NarL and NarP proteins are homologous response regulators that function to regulate anaerobic respiratory gene expression in response to nitrate and nitrite in Escherichia coli. Expression of the aeg-46.5 operon (anaerobically expressed gene at 46.5 minutes on the genetic map) is induced during anaerobic growth by the global transcriptional regulatory protein Fnr. aeg-46.5 operon expression is further induced by the NarP protein in response to nitrate or nitrite and this induction is antagonized by NarL. We used in vivo and in vitro techniques to investigate how these three transcriptional regulatory proteins control the activity of a single promoter. Deletion and mutational analysis of the aeg-46.5 operon control region identified two distinct cis-acting elements. A sequence with similarity to the Fnr-binding site consensus, centered at position -64.5, was essential for Fnr-dependent anaerobic induction of aeg-46.5 operon expression. In all other naturally occurring Fnr-dependent promoters the primary Fnr-binding site is centered between -40 and -50. The second cis-acting element, a region of perfect symmetry centered at -44.5, shares sequence similarity with the NarL-binding site consensus. This region was required for nitrate and nitrite induction of aeg-46.5 operon expression. We purified the NarP and NarL proteins as maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion proteins and investigated their interaction with the aeg-46.5 operon control region. Incubation with the phospho-donor, acetyl phosphate, allowed both MBP-NarP and MBP-NarL to protect the -44.5 region of the aeg-46.5 operon control region from DNase I cleavage. Single and double nucleotide substitutions in the -44.5 region reduced or abolished nitrate and nitrite induction of aeg-46.5 operon expression in vivo and prevented the binding of MBP-NarP and MBP-NarL to the control region in vitro. Presumably, the NarP and NarL proteins compete for the -44.5 binding site to regulate aeg-46.5 operon expression in response to nitrate and nitrite. Apparently, only the NarP protein is competent to activate transcription of the aeg-46.5 operon when bound to the -44.5 region.},

The DNA sequence of nrfA encodes a tetrahaem c-type cytochrome with a predicted M(r) for the unprocessed product of 53,788. Cleavage of the putative signal peptide at Ala-26 would result in a mature, periplasmic cytochrome of M(r) 50,580 rather than a larger hexahaem cytochrome, as has been widely reported previously. A cytochrome of this size was detected by staining SDS-polyacrylamide gels for covalently bound haem. This cytochrome was partially purified by anion exchange chromatography and confirmed to be cytochrome c552 by difference spectroscopy. Similar cytochromes were detected in five other E. coli strains including strain ST 249, which was used previously to purify and characterize the protein. A plasmid with an in-phase deletion within nrfA directed the synthesis of a truncated haemoprotein of the predicted mass. In-phase translational fusions to lacZ were used to locate the nrfA translation start, and the transcription start site was found by S1 mapping. Expression from the FNR-dependent nrfA promoter was almost totally repressed during aerobic growth, partially induced during anaerobic growth in the absence of nitrite or in the presence of nitrate, but fully induced only during anaerobic growth in the presence of nitrite. No nitrate repression was detected in a narL mutant, but nitrite induction was unaffected, indicating that the nitrite-sensing mechanism is independent of the NarL protein. Expression from the nrfA promoter was subject to glucose repression but regulation was independent of the CRP-cAMP complex.},

Hydropathy analysis classified NosR as an integral membrane protein with at least seven membrane-spanning segments. No similarity to known bacterial regulator proteins was found in a data bank search. However, the C terminus of NosR shows sequence similarity to the cysteine clusters of several 2[4Fe-4S] bacterial ferrodoxins. A monocistronic mRNA for nosZ which allowed us to monitor NosR function was identified. Complementation of Nos- mutant MK418 (nosR::Tn5) with the nosR gene supplied in trans restored nosZ transcription and expression of a catalytically active N2O reductase.

	abstract = {The synthesis of proteins necessary for the respiratory reduction of nitrate to dinitrogen is induced in most denitrifying bacteria by a shift to anaerobiosis. A homolog of the fur gene, which encodes a redox-active transcriptional activator in Escherichia coli, was isolated from Pseudomonas stutzeri by using the anr gene of Pseudomonas aeruginosa as the hybridization probe (R. G. Sawers, Mol. Microbiol. 5:1469-1481, 1991). The coding region was located on a 3-kb SmaI fragment. An open reading frame of 735 nucleotides, designated fnrA, had the coding potential for a protein of 244 amino acids (M(r) = 27,089) with 51.2\% positional identity to the Fnr protein of E. coli and 86.1\% to the Anr protein of P. aeruginosa. The fnrA gene gave a single transcript of 0.85 kb and complemented nitrate-dependent anaerobic growth of an fnr deletion mutant of E. coli. An open reading frame immediately downstream of fnrA encoded adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.7). Mutations in fnrA were generated in vitro by insertional mutagenesis followed by gene replacement. Gene inactivation was shown by loss of the fnrA transcript and detection of an arginine deiminase (EC 3.5.3.6)-negative phenotype in the mutants. However, neither the enzymatic activities nor the levels of anaerobic expression of the respiratory enzymes nitrate reductase (EC 1.7.99.4), nitrate reductase (EC 1.9.3.2), NO reductase (EC 1.7.99.7), and N2O reductase (EC 1.7.99.6) were changed in fnrA mutants versus the P. stutzeri wild type. A promoter-probe vector for Fnr-dependent transcription was activated anaerobically in the fnrA mutants, suggesting the existence of a second Fnr homolog in the same bacterium. The Fnr-binding motifs, apparent in the promoter region of genes encoding denitrification components of P. stutzeri, are likely to be recognized by this second Fnr homolog. Preliminary evidence indicates also the presence of the catabolite activator protein, Crp, in P. stutzeri.},

We report the purification and characterization of the first single mutant of P. aeruginosa cd1 NiR in which Tyr10 has been replaced by Phe; this amino acid was chosen as a possibly important residue in the catalytic mechanism of this enzyme based on the proposal (Fulop, V., Moir, J.W.B., Ferguson, S.J. and Hajdu, J. (1995) Cell 81, 369-377) that the topologically homologous Tyr25 plays a crucial role in controlling the activity of the cd1 NiR from Thiosphaera pantotropha. Our results show that in P. aeruginosa NiR substitution of Tyr10 with Phe has no effect on the activity, optical spectroscopy and electron transfer kinetics of the enzyme, indicating that distal coordination of the Fe3+ of the d1 heme is provided by different side-chains in different species.},

	abstract = {Nitrous oxide reductase from the denitrifying bacterium Pseudomonas perfectomarina has been isolated and purified to homogeneity. The enzyme contained about eight copper atoms/120 kDa and was composed of two presumably identical subunits. The isoelectric point was 5.1. Several spectroscopically distinct forms of the enzyme were identified. A 'pink' form of the enzyme was obtained when the purification was done aerobically. The specific activity of this species was around 30 nkat/mg protein as measured by the nitrous-oxide-dependent oxidation of photochemically reduced benzyl viologen. A 'purple' form of the enzyme, whose catalytic activity was 2-5-fold higher, was obtained when the purification was done anaerobically. The activity of both forms of the enzyme was substantially increased by dialyzing the protein against 2-(N-cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonate buffer at pH approximately equal to 10. A maximal activity of 1000 nkat/mg protein has been obtained for the purple form using this procedure. A 'blue', enzymatically inactive form of the enzyme resulted when either the pink or the purple species was exposed to excess dithionite or ascorbate. Anaerobic, potentiometric titrations of both the purple and the pink form of the enzyme gave a Nernst factor, n540, of 0.95 and a midpoint potential, E'0,540 of +260 mV (vs SHE, 25 degrees C, Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.5). Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and optical spectra of N2O reductase suggested the presence of an unusual type 1 copper center. Type 2 copper was absent. The hyperfine splitting in the g parallel region consisted of a seven-line pattern. In the presence of excess of reductant, a broad EPR signal with g values at 2.18 and 2.06 was observed. The EPR spectra of the pink and purple forms of the enzyme were similar; however, the spectrum of the purple form was better resolved with g parallel = 2.18 (A parallel = 3.83 mT) and g perpendicular = 2.03 (A perpendicular = 2.8 mT). Most of the copper in N2O reductase was removed by anaerobic dialysis against KCN. Reaction of the apoprotein with Cu(en)2SO4 partially regenerated the optical and EPR spectra of the holoprotein; the resulting protein was enzymatically inactive. Monospecific antibodies against the copper protein strongly inhibited the N2O reductase activity of purified samples and cell-free extracts.},

The products of the reaction, in which a deoxyribonucleotide was added to the 3' hydroxyl terminus of a blunt-ended DNA substrate, were analyzed by electrophoresis on high resolution, denaturing polyacrylamide gels. DNA polymerase from Thermus aquaticus, polymerase alpha from chick embryo, rat polymerase beta, reverse transcriptase from avian myeloblastosis virus, and DNA polymerase I from Saccharomyces cerevisiae all carried out the blunt-end addition reaction. The reaction required a duplex DNA substrate but did not require coding information from the template strand.

J. (1986) Biochem. J. 233, 893-898]. However, the X-ray structure of Thiosphaera pantotropha cytochrome cd1 reveals bis-histidine ligation for heme c. It is confirmed by EPR and near-infrared (NIR) MCD measurements that the bis-histidine coordination remains unaltered in the solution phase. Hence, the difference between the heme c ligation states defines two distinct classes of oxidized cytochromes cd1 as isolated. A weak feature in the T. pantotropha NIR MCD at 1900 nm suggests that a small population of heme c has histidine-methionine coordination. The ligation state of heme d1 cannot be defined with the same level of confidence, because the porphyrin-to-Fe(III) charge-transfer (CT) bands are less well characterized for this class of partially reduced porphyrin ring. However, variable temperature absorption and MCD spectra show that, in the T. pantotropha enzyme, heme d1 exists in a thermal low-spin/high-spin mixture with the low-spin as the ground state, whereas in P. stutzeri cytochrome cd1, and d1 heme is low-spin at all temperatures. A weak band, assigned as the heme d1 porphyrin-pi(a1u,a2u)-to-ferric(d) charge-transfer transition has been identified for the first time at 2170 nm. Its magnetic properties show the heme d1 to have an unusual (dxz,yz)4(dxy)1 electronic ground state as is found for low-spin Fe(III) chlorins [Cheesman, M. R., and Walker, F. A. (1996) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 118, 7373-7380]. It is proposed that the localization of the Fe(III) unpaired d-electron in an orbital lying in the heme plane may decrease the affinity of the Fe(III) heme for unsaturated ligands such as NO. Although heme d1 in the enzymes from P. stutzeri and T. pantotropha shows different temperature-dependent spin properties, the positions of the low-spin Fe(III) alpha-absorption band, at approximately 640 nm, are very similar to those observed for cytochromes cd1 from eight other sources, suggesting that all have similar strength fields from the axial ligands and, hence, that all have the same coordination, namely histidine-tyrosine or possibly histidine-hydroxide at the heme.},

	abstract = {The narX, narQ and narL genes of Escherichia coli encode a nitrate-responsive two-component regulatory system that controls the expression of many anaerobic electron-transport- and fermentation-related genes. When nitrate is present, the NarX and NarQ sensor-transmitter proteins function to activate the response-regulator protein, NarL, which in turn binds to its DNA-recognition sites to modulate gene expression. The sensor-transmitter proteins are anchored in the cytoplasmic membrane by two transmembrane domains that are separated by a periplasmic region of approximately 115 amino acids. In this study we report the isolation and characterization of narX* (star) mutants that constitutively activate nitrate reductase (narGHJI) gene expression and repress fumarate reductase (frdABCD) gene expression when no nitrate is provided for the cell. An additional narX mutant was identified that has lost its ability to respond to environmental signals. Each narX defect was caused by a single amino acid substitution within a conserved 17 amino acid sequence, called the 'P-box', in the periplasmic exposed region of the NarX protein. As a result, DNA binding is then 'locked-on' or 'locked-off' to give the observed pattern of gene expression. Diploid analysis of these narX mutants showed that a NarX P-box mutant which conferred a 'locked-on' phenotype was trans dominant over wild-type NarX. Both were also trans dominant over the NarX P-box mutant which conferred a 'locked-off' phenotype. Certain narX P-box mutations, when combined with a narX 'linker' region mutation, were recessive to the NarX linker mutation. Finally, a truncated form of the NarX protein that lacked the periplasmic and membrane regions also showed a 'locked-on' phenotype in vivo. Thus, the periplasmic and membrane domains are essential for signal transduction to NarL. From these findings, we propose that nitrate is detected in the periplasmic space of the cell, and that a signal-transduction event through the cytoplasmic membrane into the interior of the cell modulates the NarX-dependent phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of NarL.},

The contribution that aerobic nitrate respiration makes to the environmental nitrogen cycle has not been studied. As a first step in addressing this question, a strategy which allows for the isolation of organisms capable of reducing nitrate to nitrite following aerobic growth has been developed. Twenty-nine such strains have been isolated from three soils and a freshwater sediment and shown to comprise members of three genera (Pseudomonas, Aeromonas, and Moraxella). All of these strains expressed a nitrate reductase with an active site located in the periplasmic compartment. Twenty-two of the strains showed significant rates of nitrate respiration in the presence of oxygen when assayed with physiological electron donors. Also isolated was one member of the gram-positive genus Arthrobacter, which was likewise able to respire nitrate in the presence of oxygen but appeared to express a different type of nitrate reductase. In the four environments studied, culturable bacteria capable of aerobic nitrate respiration were isolated in significant numbers (10(4) to 10(7) per g of soil or sediment) and in three cases were as abundant as, or more abundant than, culturable bacteria capable of denitrification. Thus, it seems likely that the corespiration of nitrate and oxygen may indeed make a significant contribution to the flux of nitrate to nitrite in the environment.},

Calculated values of delta Ed-c, the difference in reduction potential between the heme c and heme d moieties, at pH 8.0 were -25 +/- 5 (unliganded), -10 +/- 5 (enzyme-CO), and -25 +/- 5 mV (enzyme-CN). Relative rates of heme c and heme d reduction were found to be dependent upon type of ligand, reductant, and pH. Evidence for a cooperative heme c-heme d interaction is discussed.},

	abstract = {1. A Clark-type electrode that responds to nitric oxide has been used to show that cytoplasmic membrane vesicles of Paracoccus denitrificans have a nitric-oxide reductase activity. Nitrous oxide is the reaction product. NADH, succinate or isoascorbate plus 2,3,5,6-tetramethyl-1,4-phenylene diamine can act as reductants. The NADH-dependent activity is resistant to freezing of the vesicles and thus the NADH:nitric-oxide oxidoreductase activity of stored frozen vesicles provides a method for calibrating the electrode by titration of dissolved nitric oxide with NADH. The periplasmic nitrite reductase and nitrous-oxide reductase enzymes are absent from the vesicles which indicates that nitric-oxide reductase is a discrete enzyme associated with the denitrification process. This conclusion was supported by the finding that nitric-oxide reductase activity was absent from both membranes prepared from aerobically grown P. denitrificans and bovine heart submitochondrial particles. 2. The NADH: nitric-oxide oxidoreductase activity was inhibited by concentrations of antimycin or myxothiazol that were just sufficient to inhibit the cytochrome bc1 complex of the ubiquinol--cytochrome-c oxidoreductase. The activity was deduced to be proton translocating by the observations of: (a) up to 3.5-fold stimulation upon addition of an uncoupler; and (b) ATP synthesis with a P:2e ratio of 0.75. 3. Nitrite reductase of cytochrome cd1 type was highly purified from P. denitrificans in a new, high-yield, rapid two- or three-step procedure. This enzyme catalysed stoichiometric synthesis of nitric oxide. This observation, taken together with the finding that the maximum rate of NADH:nitric-oxide oxidoreductase activity catalysed by the vesicles was comparable with that of NADH:nitrate-oxidoreductase, is consistent with a role for nitric-oxide reductase in the physiological conversion of nitrate or nitrite to dinitrogen gas. 4. Intact cells of P. denitrificans also reduced nitric oxide in an antimycin- or myxothiazol-sensitive manner. However, nitric oxide was not detected by the electrode during the reduction of nitrate. Nitric-oxide synthesis from nitrate could be detected with cells in the presence of very low concentrations of Triton X-100 which selectively inhibits nitric-oxide reductase activity. 5. Nitric oxide was detected as an intermediate in denitrification by including haemoglobin with an anaerobic suspension of cells that was reducing nitrate. The characteristic spectrum of the nitric oxide derivative of haemoglobin was observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

The purified enzyme had a specific activity of 11 mumols.min-1.mg of protein-1 and the Km(NO) was estimated as less than 10 microM. The enzyme formed N2O from NO with the expected stoichiometry. These observations support the view that NO reductase is a discrete enzyme that participates in the denitrification process. The enzyme contained both b- and c-type haems.

Valinomycin does not substitute for nigericin. Respiration-driven transport is observed in right-side-out vesicles but not in inside-out vesicles, whereas transport driven by the addition of KCL (in the presence of nigericin) or of NH4CL is observed in both types of membrane vesicle. The active transport of sulphate into these vesicles is shown to be carrier-mediated by its sensitivity to thiol-group reagents. It is proposed that the sulphate carrier in the plasma membrane of P. denitrificans operates by a mechanism of electroneutral proton symport, and is capable of actively transporting sulphate in either direction across the plasma membrane, but that in whole cells respiration-driven proton expulsion drives the accumulative uptake of sulphate.},

	abstract = {A two-component T7 expression system was developed for efficient expression of genes in the nonenteric bacterium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The first component of the expression system is a bacteriophage-based transposable element that contains a lacUV5/lacIq-regulated T7 RNA polymerase gene and a selectable antibiotic-resistance determinant. This element, designated miniD-180, was stably integrated into the P. aeruginosa PAO1 chromosome. The second component of this system includes several improved broad-host-range expression vectors containing the T7 gene 10 promoter and multiple cloning site (MCS). These vectors (pEB8, pEB11, and pEB12) contain transcriptional terminators (T1(4)) upstream from the T7 promoter, and T7 terminators downstream from the MCS. Because the T7 promoter is somewhat leaky in these vectors, pEB14 was constructed to decrease transcription of target genes by basal levels of T7 RNA polymerase. This vector contains a core sequence of the lac operator located 19 bp downstream from the transcriptional start point of the T7 promoter, thereby providing a dually regulated system. The utility of this system was demonstrated by placing a promoterless chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) cassette under control of the T7 promoter and monitoring the isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside-dependent accumulation of CAT in cell-free extracts of P. aeruginosa. We observed up to nearly a 60-fold increase in CAT levels 4 h post-induction, at which time this polypeptide represented up to 20\% of the total soluble protein.},

The NarY polypeptide, which contains the same four cysteine clusters in the same order as NarH, is probably an electron transfer unit of the complex. Upstream of narZ, an open reading frame, ORFA, is present which could encode a product which has homology (73\% identity) with the COOH-terminal end of NarK. The ORFA-narZ intergenic region, however, is about 80 nucleotides long and does not contain the cis-acting elements, NarL and Fnr boxes, nor the terC4 terminator sequence present in the 500 nucleotide narK-narG intergenic region. This might explain why the narZYWV and the narGHJI operons are regulated differently. Our results tend to support the hypothesis that a DNA fragment larger than that encompassing the narGHJI genes has been duplicated.},

The enzyme is a complex of a 93-kDa polypeptide and a 16-kDa nitrate-oxidizable cytochrome c552. The complex contains molybdenum; a fluorescent compound with spectral features of a pterin derivative can be extracted. In contrast to the dissimilatory membrane-bound nitrate reductases, the periplasmic nitrate reductase shows high specificity for nitrate as a substrate and is insensitive to inhibition by azide. The 93-kDa subunit exhibits immunological cross-reactivity with the catalytic subunit of Rhodobacter capsulatus N22DNAR+ periplasmic nitrate reductase. Mass spectrometric comparisons of holo-cytochrome c552 and apo-cytochrome c552 demonstrated that the polypeptide bound two haem groups. Mediated redox potentiometry of the cytochrome indicated that the haem groups have reduction potentials (pH = 7.0) of approximately -15 mV and + 80 mV. The functional significance of these potentials is discussed in relation to the proposed physiological role of the enzyme as a redox valve.},

Cysteine-181 is proposed to ligate the molybdenum atom. It is inferred that the active site of the periplasmic nitrate reductase is structurally related to those of the molybdenum-dependent formate dehydrogenases and bacterial assimilatory nitrate reductases, but is distinct from that of the membrane-bound respiratory nitrate reductases. A four-cysteine motif at the N-terminus of NapA binds a [4Fe-4S] cluster. The DNA- and protein-derived primary sequence of NapB confirm that this protein is a dihaem c-type cytochrome and, together with spectroscopic data, indicate that both NapB haems have bis-histidine ligation. napC is predicted to code for a membrane-anchored tetrahaem c-type cytochrome that shows sequence similarity to the NirT cytochrome c family. NapC may be the direct electron donor to the NapAB complex. napD is predicted to encode a soluble cytoplasmic protein and napE a monotopic integral membrane protein, napDABC genes can be discerned at the aeg-46.5 locus of Escherichia coli K-12, suggesting that this operon encodes a periplasmic nitrate reductase system, while napD and napC are identified adjacent to the napAB genes of Alcaligenes eutrophus H16.},

The derived gene products show high sequence similarity to the equivalent (beta, putative delta and gamma) subunits of the two membrane-bound nitrate reductases of the enteric bacterium Escherichia coli. All iron-sulphur cluster ligands proposed for the E. coli beta subunits are conserved in T. pantotropha NarH. Secondary structure analysis of NarJ suggests that this protein has a predominantly alpha-helical structure. Comparison of T. pantotropha NarI with the b-haem-binding integral membrane subunits of the E. coli enzymes allows assignment of His-53, His-63, His-186 and His-204 (T. pantotropha NarI numbering) as b-haem axial ligands and the construction of a three-dimensional model of this subunit. This model, in which the two b-haems are in different halves of the membrane bilayer, is consistent with a mechanism of energy conservation whereby electrons are moved from the periplasmic to the cytoplasmic side of the membrane via the haems. Similar movement of electrons is required in the membrane-bound uptake hydrogenases and membrane-bound formate dehydrogenases. We have identified two pairs of conserved histidine residues in the integral membrane subunits of these enzymes that are appropriately positioned to bind one haem towards each side of the membrane bilayer. One subunit of a hydrogenase complex involved in transfer of electrons across the cytoplasmic membrane of sulphate-reducing bacteria has structural resemblance to NarI.},

It is argued, on the basis of inhibitor sensitivities and from immunological evidence, that the same nitrous oxide reductase is involved in nitrous oxide reduction in aerobically grown cells. The purified nitrous oxide reductase was shown to have molecular properties very similar to nitrous oxide reductases previously isolated from anaerobically denitrifying bacteria. The visible absorption spectra of the T. pantotropha enzyme resemble those of the oxygen-affected form of nitrous oxide reductases from other organisms. It is thus concluded that the T. pantotropha nitrous oxide reductase is not peculiarly resistant to the structural changes caused by oxygen. The activity of the purified T. pantotropha nitrous oxide reductase was reconstituted in vitro using horse heart cytochrome c, T. pantotropha cytochrome c551 and T. pantotropha pseudoazurin as electron donors. It is suggested on this basis that either of the T. pantotropha electron-carrier proteins are possible physiological electron donors to T. pantotropha nitrous oxide reductase. Oxygen was shown not to inhibit the in-vitro reduction of nitrous oxide with horse heart ferrocytochrome c as electron donor to the reductase.},

However, the pO2 values that gave rise to half-maximal repression (pO(0.5)) were dependent on the particular promoter and varied between 1 and 5 millibars (1 bar = 10(5) Pa). The pO(0.5) value for the ArcA-regulated succinate dehydrogenase genes was in the same range (pO(0.5) = 4.6 millibars). At these pO2 values, the cytoplasm can be calculated to be well supplied with O2 by diffusion. Therefore, intracellular O2 could provide the signal to FNR, suggesting that there is no need for a signal transfer chain. Genetic inactivation of the enzymes and coenzymes of aerobic respiration had no or limited effects on the pO(0.5) of FNR-regulated genes. Thus, neither the components of aerobic respiration nor their redox state are the primary sites for O2 sensing, supporting the significance of intracellular O2. Non-redox-active, structural O2 analogs like CO, CN-, and N3-, could not mimic the effect of O2 on FNR-regulated genes under anaerobic conditions and did not decrease the inhibitory effect of O2 under aerobic conditions.},

The denitrification activity of the cells was monitored by measuring the formation of denitrification products (nitrite, nitric oxide, nitrous oxide, and dinitrogen), individual mRNA levels for the nitrate, nitrite, and nitrous oxide reductases, and the concentration of the nitrite reductase enzyme with polyclonal antibodies against the cd1-type nitrite reductase. On a change from aerobic to anaerobic respiration, the culture entered an unstable transition phase during which the denitrification pathway became induced. The onset of this phase was formed by a 15- to 45-fold increase of the mRNA levels for the individual denitrification enzymes. All mRNAs accumulated during a short period, after which their overall concentration declined to reach a stable value slightly higher than that observed under aerobic steady-state conditions. Interestingly, the first mRNAs to be formed were those for nitrate and nitrous oxide reductase. The nitrite reductase mRNA appeared significantly later, suggesting different modes of regulation for the three genes. Unlike the mRNA levels, the level of the nitrite reductase protein increased slowly during the anaerobic period, reaching a stable value about 30 h after the switch. All denitrification intermediates could be observed transiently, but when the new anaerobic steady state was reached, dinitrogen was the main product. When the anaerobic cultures were switched back to aerobic respiration, denitrification of the cells stopped at once, although sufficient nitrite reductase was still present. We could observe that the mRNA levels for the individual denitrification enzymes decreased slightly to their aerobic, uninduced levels. The nitrite reductase protein was not actively degraded during the aerobic period.},

	abstract = {The binding of cyanide to both oxidized and ascorbate-reduced forms of Pseudomonas cytochrome c-551 oxidase was investigated. Spectral studies on the oxidized enzyme and its apoprotein showed that the ligand can bind to both the c and d, haem components of the molecule, and kinetic observations indicated that both chromophores reacted, under a variety of conditions, with very similar rates. Cyanide combination velocities were dependent on ligand concentration, and increasing the pH also accelerated the reaction; the second-order rate constant was estimated as approx. 0.2M-1 . s-1 at pH 7.0. The binding of cyanide to the protein was observed to have a considerable influence on reduction of the enzyme by ascorbate. Spectral and kinetic observations have revealed that the species haem d13+-cyanide and any unbound haem c may react relatively rapidly with the reductant, but the behaviour of cyanide-bound haem c indicates that it may not be reduced without prior dissociation of the ligand, which occurs relatively slowly. The reaction of reduced Pseudomonas cytochrome oxidase with cyanide is radically different from that of the oxidized protein. In this case the ligand only binds to the haem d1 component and reacts much more rapidly. Stopped-flow kinetic measurements showed the binding to be biphasic in form. Both the rates of these processes were dependent on cyanide concentration, with the fast phase having a second-order rate constant of 9.3 X 10(5) M-1 . s-1 and the slow phase one of 2.3 X 10(5) M-1 . s-1. The relative proportions of the two phases also showed a dependency on cyanide concentration, the slower phase increasing as the cyanide concentration decreased. Computer simulations indicate that a reaction scheme originally proposed for the reaction of the enzyme with CO is capable of providing a reasonable explanation of the experimental results. Static-titration data of the reduced enzyme with with cyanide indicated that the binding was non-stoicheiometric, the ligand-binding curve being sigmoidal in shape. A Hill plot of the results yielded a Hill coefficient of 2.6.},

Steady-state kinetic constants of the electron donors, quinol, sodium ascorbate, reduced Pseudomonas azurin and Pseudomonas ferrocytochrome c551 were investigated giving Km values of 30mM, 4mM, 49muM and 5.6muM respectively. The two protein substrates were observed to be subject to product inhibition and the Ki for oxidized Pseudomonas azurin was evaluated at 4.9muM. Steady-state kinetics were also used to investigate the effects of the oxidation products of dithionite on the oxidase and nitrite reductase activities of Pseudomonas cytochrome oxidase. These experiments showed that whereas the oxidase activity was inhibited, the nitrite reductase activity was slightly enhanced.},

Two components were identified with mid-point potentials +95 mV and +210 mV. 2. Washing, in the absence of Mg2+ ions, of cytoplasmic membrane vesicles from P. denitrificans promoted selective release of nitrate reductase activity. The released enzyme was purified by chromatography and shown to contain alpha and beta, but not gamma polypeptides. A haem spectrum was absent, consistent with the lack of the gamma subunit. The alpha and beta polypeptides of the water-soluble nitrate reductase had molecular masses that were identical to those of the detergent-purified enzyme and also of the nitrate reductase in cytoplasmic membranes. This observation, together with the failure of protease inhibitors to prevent release from the membrane, indicates that the release is not related to limited proteolysis of the alpha and/or beta polypeptides. The relative molecular mass of the water-soluble alpha beta enzyme was estimated to be approximately 200,000. 3. The water-soluble nitrate reductase was released from intact inverted cytoplasmic membrane vesicles as judged by loss of NADH-NO3- reductase activity and retention by the vesicles after washing of uncoupler-sensitive NADH-oxidase activity. These observations show that alpha and beta polypeptides, and therefore the active site for nitrate reduction, are located on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. 4. Attempts to reverse the nitrate reductase activity of the enzyme, using nitrate as reductant plus ferricyanide or chlorate as tested oxidants, were unsuccessful. The implications for the mechanism of the enzyme are discussed.},

The d1 haem, although bound by an extensive network of hydrogen bonds, is not distorted in its binding pocket and is confirmed to have exactly the dioxoisobacteriochlorin structure proposed from chemical studies. A biological rationale is advanced for the undistorted structure of the d1 haem and the large number of hydrogen bonds it makes. The beta-propeller domain can be closely superimposed on that of methanol dehydrogenase despite the enzymes sharing no common sequence motifs and using a different set of interactions to "Velcro" close the propeller. The sequence and likely structural relationships between cytochrome cd1 or methanol dehydrogenase and other predicted eight-bladed beta-propeller domains in proteins, such as the pyrolloquinoline quinone-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase, are discussed and compared with other propeller proteins. From sequencing the nirS gene of Thiosphaera pantotropha, it is established that the amino acid sequence deduced previously in part from X-ray diffraction data at lower resolution was largely correct, as was the proposal that eight N-terminal amino acid residues were not seen in the structure. The unusual haem iron environments in both the c-type cytochrome domain, with His/His coordination, and the d1-type cytochrome domain with Tyr/His coordination are related to the functions of the redox centres.},

	abstract = {Paracoccus denitrificans and its near relative Paracoccus versutus (formerly known as Thiobacilllus versutus) have been attracting increasing attention because the aerobic respiratory system of P. denitrificans has long been regarded as a model for that of the mitochondrion, with which there are many components (e.g., cytochrome aa3 oxidase) in common. Members of the genus exhibit a great range of metabolic flexibility, particularly with respect to processes involving respiration. Prominent examples of flexibility are the use in denitrification of nitrate, nitrite, nitrous oxide, and nitric oxide as alternative electron acceptors to oxygen and the ability to use C1 compounds (e.g., methanol and methylamine) as electron donors to the respiratory chains. The proteins required for these respiratory processes are not constitutive, and the underlying complex regulatory systems that regulate their expression are beginning to be unraveled. There has been uncertainty about whether transcription in a member of the alpha-3 Proteobacteria such as P. denitrificans involves a conventional sigma70-type RNA polymerase, especially since canonical -35 and -10 DNA binding sites have not been readily identified. In this review, we argue that many genes, in particular those encoding constitutive proteins, may be under the control of a sigma70 RNA polymerase very closely related to that of Rhodobacter capsulatus. While the main focus is on the structure and regulation of genes coding for products involved in respiratory processes in Paracoccus, the current state of knowledge of the components of such respiratory pathways, and their biogenesis, is also reviewed.},

The B. japonicum fixK-like gene, when expressed from a lac promoter, could functionally complement an fnr mutant strain of E. coli and activate transcription from an fnr-dependent promoter in the E. coli background; this activation was sixfold higher in anaerobic cultures than in aerobically grown cells, a finding that suggested oxygen sensitivity of the FixK protein and was consistent with the presence of a cysteine-rich, putatively oxygen-responsive domain at its N-terminal end. Similar to the situation in Rhizobium meliloti, expression of the fixK gene in B. japonicum was shown to be induced at low O2 tension and this induction was dependent on the two-component regulatory system FixLJ. Despite this dependency, however, a B. japonicum fixK mutant did not have the phenotypic characteristics of B. japonicum fixL and fixJ mutants: the fixK mutant was neither Fix- in symbiosis with soybean plants nor defective in anaerobic respiration with nitrate as the terminal electron acceptor. Also, the fixK mutant was unaffected in the expression of one of the two B. japonicum sigma 54 genes, rpoN1, which was previously shown to be controlled by the fixLJ genes. When fixK was introduced into the B. japonicum fixJ mutant and expressed therein from a constitutive promoter (i.e., uncoupling it from regulation by FixJ), the FixK protein thus synthesized fully restored anaerobic nitrate respiration in that strain. We interpret this to mean that the B. japonicum wild type has two homologs of fixLJ-regulated fixK genes which can functionally substitute for each other.},

We have used magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectroscopy, a highly accurate method for assignment of heme spin- and coordination-states, to study native, solution forms of bovine liver, M. luteus, and A. niger catalases. All three enzymes display similar spectral features with the weak (approximately 5 delta epsilon M [moles.cm.Tesla]-1) intensity typical of a 5-coordinate high-spin ferric heme.

	abstract = {Denitrification and methylotrophy in Paracoccus denitrificans are discussed. The properties of the enzymes of denitrification: the nitrate-nitrite antiporter, nitrate reductase, nitrite reductase, nitric oxide reductase and nitrous oxide reductase are described. The genes for none of these proteins have yet been cloned and sequenced from P. denitrificans. A number of sequences are available for enzymes from Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas stutzeri and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It is concluded that pathway specific c-type cytochromes are involved in denitrification. At least 40 genes are involved in denitrification. In methanol oxidation at least 20 genes are involved. In this case too pathway specific c-type cytochromes are involved. The sequence homology between the quinoproteins methanol dehydrogenase, alcoholde-hydrogenase and glucose dehydrogenase is discussed. This superfamily of proteins is believed to be derived from a common ancestor. The moxFJGI operon determines the structural components of methanol dehydrogenase and the associated c-type cytochrome. Upstream of this operon 3 regulatory proteins were found. The moxY protein shows the general features of a sensor protein and the moxX protein those of a regulatory protein. Thus a two component regulatory system is involved in both denitrification and methylotrophy. The phylogeny of prokaryotes based on 16S rRNA sequence is discussed. It is remarkable that the 16S rRNA of Thiosphaera pantotropha is identical to that of P. denitrificans. Still these bacteria show a number of differences. T. pantotropha is able to denitrify under aerobic circumstances and it shows heterotrophic nitrification. Nitrification and heterotrophic nitrification are found in species belonging to the beta-and gamma-subdivisions of purple non-sulfur bacteria. Thus the occurrence of heterotrophic nitrification in T. pantotropha, which belongs to the alpha-subdivision of purple non-sulfur bacteria is a remarkable property. Furthermore T. pantotropha contains two nitrate reductases of which the periplasmic one is supposed to be involved in aerobic denitrification. The nitrite reductase is of the Cu-type and not of the cytochrome cd1 type as in P. denitrificans. Also the cytochrome b of the Qbc complex of T. pantotropha is highly similar to its counterpart in P. denitrificans. It is hypothesized that the differences between these two organisms which both contain large megaplasmids is due to a combination of loss of genetic information and plasmid-coded properties. The distribution of a number of complex metabolic systems in eubacteria and in a number of species belonging to the alpha-group of purple non sulphur bacteria is reviewed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

Responses are largely controlled by signal transduction systems that contain two central enzymatic components, a protein kinase that uses adenosine triphosphate to phosphorylate itself at a histidine residue and a response regulator that accepts phosphoryl groups from the kinase. This conserved phosphotransfer chemistry is found in a wide range of bacterial species and operates in diverse systems to provide different regulatory outputs. The histidine kinases are frequently membrane receptor proteins that respond to environmental signals and phosphorylate response regulators that control transcription. Four specific regulatory systems are discussed in detail: chemotaxis in response to attractant and repellent stimuli (Che), regulation of gene expression in response to nitrogen deprivation (Ntr), control of the expression of enzymes and transport systems that assimilate phosphorus (Pho), and regulation of outer membrane porin expression in response to osmolarity and other culture conditions (Omp). Several additional systems are also examined, including systems that control complex developmental processes such as sporulation and fruiting-body formation, systems required for virulent infections of plant or animal host tissues, and systems that regulate transport and metabolism. Finally, an attempt is made to understand how cross-talk between parallel phosphotransfer pathways can provide a global regulatory curcuitry.},

	abstract = {Synthesis of most anaerobic respiratory pathways is subject to dual regulation by anaerobiosis and nitrate. Anaerobic induction is mediated by the FNR protein. Dual interacting two-component regulatory systems mediate nitrate induction and repression. The response regulator protein NARL binds DNA to control nitrate induction and repression of genes encoding nitrate respiration enzymes and alternate anaerobic respiratory enzymes, respectively. The homologous protein NARP controls nitrite induction of at least two operons. Nitrate and nitrite signalling are both mediated by the homologous sensor proteins NARX and NARQ. Recent mutational analyses have defined a heptamer sequence necessary for specific DNA binding by the NARL protein. These heptamers are located at different positions in the control regions of different operons. The NARL protein-binding sites in the narG (nitrate reductase) and narK (nitrate-nitrite antiporter) operon control regions are located approximately 200bp upstream of the transcription initiation site. The integration host factor (IHF) greatly stimulates nitrate induction of these operons, indicating that a specific DNA loop brings NARL protein, bound at the upstream region, into the proximity of the promoter for transcription activation. Other NARL protein-dependent opersons do not require IHF for nitrate induction, and the arrangement of NARL heptamer sequences in these control regions is quite different. This complexity of signal transduction pathways, coupled with the diversity of control region architecture, combine to provide many interesting areas for future investigation. An additional challenge is to determine how or if the FNR and NARL proteins interact to mediate dual positive control of transcription initiation.},

The molecular basis for recognition and discrimination of their target sites has been investigated by directed amino acid substitutions in the corresponding DNA-recognition helices. In FNR, Glu-209 and Ser-212 are essential residues for the recognition of FNR sites. A V208R substitution confers CRP-site specificity without loss of FNR specificity, but this has adverse effects on anaerobic growth. In contrast, changes at two (V208R and E209D) or three (V208R, S212G and G216K) positions in FNR endow a single CRP-site binding specificity. In reciprocal experiments, two substitutions (R180V and G184S) were required to convert the binding specificity of CRP to that of FNR. Altering Asp-199 in FNR failed to produce a positive control phenotype, unlike substitutions at the comparable site in CRP. Implications for the mechanism of sequence discrimination by FNR and CRP are discussed.},

From the study of a translational fusion of fnr to the gene for beta-galactosidase (lacZ) it has been concluded that the fnr gene is expressed under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions and is subject to autoregulation and repression by glucose, particularly during anaerobic growth. These findings imply that during anaerobiosis the FNR protein adopts an active conformation, in which it functions both as a repressor of the fnr gene and as an activator of fnr-dependent genes. Sequences in the 5' non-coding region of fnr which could be involved in autoregulation are discussed. The fnr coding region was cloned into an expression vector which has allowed an amplification of FNR synthesis such that it accounts for about 2\% of total cell protein. The ability to over-produce FNR in this way should be very useful for future biochemical studies.},

	abstract = {Homologues of the transcriptional regulator FNR from Escherichia coli have been identified in a variety of taxonomically diverse bacterial species. Despite being structurally very similar, members of the FNR family have disparate regulatory roles. Those from Shewanella putrefaciens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas stutzeri and Rhodopseudomonas palustris are functionally similar to FNR in that they regulate anaerobic respiration or carbon metabolism. Four rhizobial proteins (from Rhizobium meliloti, R. leguminosarum, B. japonicum and Azorhizobium caulinodans) are involved in the regulation of nitrogen fixation; a fifth (from Rhizobium strain IC3342) has unknown function. Two proteins from mammalian pathogens (Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and Bordetella pertussis) may be involved in the regulation of toxin expression. The FNR protein of Vibrio fischeri regulates bioluminescence, and the function of the one known FNR homologue from a Gram-positive organism (Lactobacillus casei) remains to be elucidated. Some members of this family, like FNR itself, appear to function as sensors of oxygen availability, whereas others do not. The ability to sense and respond to oxygen limitation may be correlated with the presence of cysteine residues which, in the case of FNR, are thought to be involved in oxygen or redox sensing. The mechanism of DNA sequence recognition is probably conserved, or very similar, throughout this family. In a number of other Gram-negative species, there is good indirect evidence for the existence of FNR analogues; these include Alcaligenes eutrophus, A. denitrificans, A. faecalis, Paracoccus denitrificans and a number of Pseudomonas species.},

The enzyme contained four Cu atoms/subunit, was purple in color, and exhibited a broad absorption band at 550 nm with an extinction coefficient of about 11,000 M-1 x cm-1 referenced to the dimer. It was nearly inactive as prepared but could be activated by incubation with 2-(N-cyclohexylamino)ethane sulfonate buffer, pH 10, to specific activities as high as 27 mumol of N2O x min-1 x mg-1.Km for N2O and benzyl viologen radical cation was about 2 and 4 microM, respectively, both before and after enzyme activation. Activation increased the t1/2 for turnover-dependent inactivation from about 30 s to 5-10 min. Reduction of the enzyme by dithionite was kinetically biphasic and resulted in the loss of the 550-nm band and ultimate appearance of a 670-nm band. Isoelectric focusing revealed five components with pI values from 5.2 to 5.7. The pI values did not change following activation. The copper CD spectrum of the enzyme as prepared was different from that for the activated enzyme, whereas those for the enzyme after exposure to air and the activated enzyme were similar. Because the activated enzyme is a mixture of activated and inactive species, the specific activity of the activated species must be substantially greater than the observed value. Molecular heterogeneity may also explain the decreased optical absorbance and CD amplitude that resulted from the activation process. The data overall reinforce the view that the absorption spectrum of nitrous oxide reductase is not a good predictor of absolute activity.},

The beta-subunit is primarily a seven-bladed beta-propeller that is partially encircled by an extended gamma-subunit. The beta-propeller, which contains seven structurally similar WD repeats, defines the stereochemistry of the WD repeat and the probable architecture of all WD-repeat-containing domains.

	abstract = {Nitrous oxide reductase from the denitrifying bacterium Paracoccus denitrificans has been purified very nearly to homogeneity by an anaerobic procedure that results in a product with high specific activity. The enzyme is a dimer of about Mr 144,000 composed of two subunits of apparently equal Mr and contains 4 mol of Cu per mol of subunit. The isoelectric point is 4.3; specific activity at 25 degrees C, pH 7.1, is 122 mumol X min-1 X mg of protein-1; and Km is about 7 microM N2O under the same conditions. The N2O- and O2-oxidized forms of the enzyme had principal absorption bands at 550 and 820 nm; the dithionite-reduced form, at 650 nm. The extinction coefficient at 550 nm for the oxidized enzyme is about 5300 (M subunit)-1 X cm-1. Ferricyanide-oxidized enzyme and enzyme exposed to O2 for a couple of days at 4 degrees C exhibited additional bands at 480, 620, and 780 nm and had very low specific activities. Cu-EPR signals were observed with oxidized and reduced forms of the enzyme with g perpendicular values at 2.042 and 2.055, respectively. The O2-oxidized enzyme had g parallel and A parallel values of about 2.244 and 35 gauss, respectively, based on the observation of four hyperfine lines in the g parallel region. The enzyme may therefore contain at least one Cu atom approximating the "Type 1" class. Spin counts against Cu-EDTA standards suggest that 20-30\% of the enzyme-bound Cu is EPR detectable in the O2-oxidized enzyme and 7-15\% in the enzyme as prepared and in the reduced enzyme. Much of the Cu thus appears to be EPR silent. Nitrous oxide reductase was observed to undergo turnover-dependent inactivation, and nitrite and fluoride among other anions were found to accelerate this process. In a number of characteristics, the enzyme resembles nitrous oxide reductase recently purified from Pseudomonas perfectomarina and Rhodopseudomonas sphaeroides, particularly the former. Some differences appear related to whether or not purification is carried out entirely under anaerobic conditions.},

In agreement with recent sequence information from another strain of P. stutzeri (strain ZoBell), strain JM300 nir is the first gene in an operon and is followed immediately by a gene which codes for a tetraheme protein; 2.5 kb downstream from the nitrite reductase carboxyl terminus is the cytochrome c551 gene. P. stutzeri JM300 nir is 67\% homologous to P. aeruginosa nir and 88\% homologous to P. stutzeri ZoBell nir. Within the nitrite reductase promoter region is an fnr-like operator very similar to an operator upstream of a separate anaerobic pathway, that for arginine catabolism in P. aeruginosa. The denitrification genes in P. stutzeri thus may be under the same regulatory control as that found for other anaerobic pathways of pseudomonads. We have generated gene probes from restriction fragments within the nitrite reductase operon to evaluate their usefulness in ecology studies of denitrification. Probes generated from the carboxyl terminus region hybridized to denitrifying bacteria from five separate genera and did not cross-hybridize to any nondenitrifying bacteria among six genera tested. The denitrifier probes were successful in detecting denitrifying bacteria from samples such as a bioreactor consortium, aquifer microcosms, and denitrifying toluene-degrading enrichments. The probes also were used to reveal restriction fragment length polymorphism patterns indicating the diversity of denitrifiers present in these mixed communities.},

[formula: see text] The bimolecular step (Step 1) is very fast, being lost in the dead time of a rapid mixing apparatus; the stoichiometry of the complex has been estimated to correspond to one NO2- molecule/heme d1. The final species is the fully reduced enzyme with NO bound to heme d1; and at all concentrations of nitrite, there is no evidence for dissociation of NO or for further reduction of NO to N2O. Step 2 is assigned to an internal electron transfer from heme c to reduced NO-bound heme d1 occurring with a rate constant of 1 s-1; this rate is comparable to the rate of internal electron transfer previously determined when reducing the oxidized enzyme with azurin or cytochrome c551. When heme d1 is NO-bound, the rate at which heme c can accept electrons from ascorbate is remarkably increased as compared to the oxidized enzyme, suggesting an increase in the redox potential of the latter heme.},

The electron transfer in the direction of cytochrome c-551 reduction, starting with the oxidase in the reduced and CO-bound form, is monophasic, and the governing bimolecular rate constants are 1.3(+/- 0.2) x 10(7) M-1 . s-1 at pH 9.1 and 4 (+/- 1) x 10(6) M-1 . s-1 at pH 7.0. In the opposite direction, i.e. mixing the oxidized oxidase with the reduced cytochrome c-551 in the absence of O2, both a lower absorbance change and a more complex kinetic pattern were observed. With oxidized azurin instead of oxidized cytochrome c-551 the oxidation of the c haem in the CO-bound oxidase is also monophasic, and the second-order rate constant is 2 (+/- 0.7) x 10(6) M-1 . s-1 at pH 9.1. The redox potential of the c haem in the oxidase, as obtained from kinetic titrations of the completely oxidized enzyme with reduced azurin as the variable substrate, is 288 mV at pH 7.0 and 255 mV at pH 9.1. This is in contrast with the very high affinity observed in similar titrations performed with both oxidized azurin and oxidized cytochrome c-551 starting from the CO derivative of the reduced oxidase. It is concluded that: (i) azurin and cytochrome c-551 are not equally efficient in vitro as reducing substrates of the oxidase in the respiratory chain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa; (ii) CO ligation to the d1 haem in the oxidase induces a large decrease (at least 80 mV) in the redox potential of the c-haem moiety.},

	abstract = {Alcaligenes eutrophus H16 shows three distinct nitrate reductase activities (U. Warnecke-Eberz and B. Friedrich, Arch. Microbiol. 159:405-409, 1993). The periplasmic enzyme, designated NAP (nitrate reductase, periplasmic), has been isolated. The 80-fold-purified heterodimeric enzyme catalyzed nitrate reduction with reduced viologen dyes as electron donors. The nap genes were identified in a library of A. eutrophus H16 megaplasmid DNA by using oligonucleotide probes based on the amino-terminal polypeptide sequences of the two NAP subunits. The two structural genes, designated napA and napB, code for polypeptides of 93 and 18.9 kDa, respectively. Sequence comparisons indicate that the putative gene products are translated with signal peptides of 28 and 35 amino acids, respectively. This is compatible with the fact that NAP activity was found in the soluble fraction of cell extracts and suggests that the mature enzyme is located in the periplasm. The deduced sequence of the large subunit, NAPA, contained two conserved amino-terminal stretches of amino acids found in molybdenum-dependent proteins such as nitrate reductases and formate dehydrogenases, suggesting that NAPA contains the catalytic site. The predicted sequence of the small subunit, NAPB, revealed two potential heme c-binding sites, indicating its involvement in the transfer of electrons. An insertion in the napA gene led to a complete loss of NAP activity but did not abolish the ability of A. eutrophus to use nitrate as a nitrogen source or as an electron acceptor in anaerobic respiration. Nevertheless, the NAP-deficient mutant showed delayed growth after transition from aerobic to anaerobic respiration, suggesting a role for NAP in the adaptation to anaerobic metabolism.},

	abstract = {From conditions for production in Fusarium oxysporum of the unique nitrate/nitrite-inducible cytochrome P-450, tentatively called P-450dNIR, it was expected that the fungus is capable of metabolizing nitrate dissimilatively. Here we report that F. oxysporum exhibits a distinct denitrifying ability which results in the anaerobic evolution of nitrous oxide (N2O) from nitrate or nitrite. Comparison of the cell growth during denitrification indicated that the dissimilatory reduction of nitrate to nitrite is an energetically favorable process in F. oxysporum; however, further reduction of nitrite to N2O might be energy-exhausting and may function as a detoxification mechanism. A potent nitrite reductase activity to form N2O could be reconstituted by combination of the cell-free extract prepared from the denitrifying cells and an NADH-phenadinemethosulfate-dependent reducing system. The activity was strongly inhibited by carbon monoxide, cyanide, oxygen (O2), and the antibody against P-450dNIR. The results, along with those concerning inducing conditions of P-450dNIR, were highly indicative that the cytochrome is involved in the denitrifying nitrite reduction. This work has thus presented not only the first demonstration that a eukaryote exhibits a marked denitrifying ability, but also the first instance of a cytochrome P-450 that is involved in a reducing reaction with a distinct physiological significance against a hydrophilic, inorganic substrate.},

Fnr, is a transcriptional regulatory protein specific for genes encoding anaerobic respiratory functions (fumarate, nitrate and nitrite reductases, hydrogenase, etc.). In this respect Fnr may be considered analogous to the well-characterized catabolite gene activator protein (CAP), which mediates the control of catabolite-sensitive gene transcription. With a view to identifying its function, the fnr gene has recently been cloned and the primary structure of the Fnr protein deduced from the nucleotide sequence. This has revealed the presence of three regions of sequence homology with CAP. One corresponds to the DNA-binding site, a region of about 20 highly conserved amino acids that is believed to form a characteristic three-dimensional structure in several transcriptional regulators. The other regions of homology are in the nucleotide binding domain of CAP but the residues that interact with cAMP are not identical in Fnr. These homologies suggest that Fnr and CAP may have similar three-dimensional structures and that the regulation of anaerobic energy metabolism may involve interaction between Fnr and an unidentified effector molecule.},

	abstract = {A gene library of chromosomal DNA from Pseudomonas aeruginosa contained a DNA fragment which was able to restore anaerobic growth to an Escherichia coli fnr deletion mutant on glycerol/nitrate medium. The cloned gene (termed anr) was sequenced and shown to encode a protein of 244 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 27,129. The deduced amino acid sequence of the anr gene product showed considerable similarity to the FNR protein from E. coli. Expression of the anr gene in a T7 promoter/polymerase system identified ANR as a 31 kDa protein. Transcriptional analysis of the anr gene showed that it is monocistronic but apparently lacks the equivalent sites for negative autoregulation which have been shown to be present in the promoter region of the E. coli fnr gene. The ANR protein was shown to activate transcription of the pfl gene in E. coli in response to anaerobiosis, as well as being able to restore the activity of three anaerobically inducible enzymes. A P. aeruginosa mutant incapable of growing anaerobically with nitrate or on arginine was fully complemented by the anr gene, indicating that it probably has a function in controlling anaerobic gene expression in Pseudomonas. Further corroboration for this assumption was provided by S1 nuclease analysis of transcription of the multiple promoters of the E. coli pfl operon in P. aeruginosa. Transcription was induced by oxygen limitation and was completely ANR-dependent in both aerobic and anaerobic cells. Removal of the upstream regulatory sequence of the pfl operon, which includes the sequences required for FNR-dependent regulation in E. coli, removed ANR-dependent transcriptional control of the remaining pfl promoters, irrespective of the cellular oxygen status. These results imply that the mechanisms by which ANR and FNR regulate transcription are fundamentally similar.},

	abstract = {Anaerobic expression of the focA pfl operon is dependent on the transcription factors ArcA and FNR and transcription is directed by multiple, anaerobically regulated promoters. A FNR-binding site is centred at -41.5 bp relative to the P6 promoter, inactivation of which severely impairs anaerobic expression of the complete operon. Mutations were introduced into this binding site to create a consensus recognition site for the cAMP-receptor protein, CRP (CC-site), and one that was recognised by both CRP and FNR (CF-site). Transcription directed by these mutant binding sites in vivo in different promoter constructs was analysed by primer extension and by constructing lacZ operon fusions. With a derivative including only the P6 promoter and the CF-binding site, transcription was shown to be independent of oxygen and was activated by CRP or FNR. In agreement with previous findings, FNR only activated transcription anaerobically. In a construct including the CC-binding site transcription was strong. CRP dependent and initiated at the identical site to the wild-type promoter. Transcription activation from the CC-site was exquisitely sensitive to low cAMP concentration. Surprisingly, in a crp mutant, anaerobically inducible, FNR-dependent transcription directed by the CC-site was detected, indicating that FNR can recognise a consensus CRP-binding site in vivo. A strain unable to synthesise CRP or FNR exhibited no transcription from the P6 promoter. Essentially the same results were observed in a series of constructs that also included the promoter P7 and its regulatory sequences. Evidence is also presented which demonstrates that CRP activates transcription from the natural FNR-binding site of the P6 promoter. In vitro DNA-binding studies showed that CRP specifically interacted with the FNR-binding site, protecting exactly the same sequence as that protected by the FNR protein. Interaction of CRP with the natural FNR-binding site was reduced greater than 50-fold compared to its interaction with the mutant CC-binding site. Although we could not demonstrate that FNR interacted with the CC-binding site in vitro, it did bind to the CF-site giving the same protection as observed with the wild-type FNR-binding site. FNR also activated transcription from the CF-site in vitro, giving further support to the idea that a single functional DNA half-site is sufficient to direct binding and transcription activation by a dimeric transcription factor.},

This promoter has a GG-N10-GC motif with a 16 bp spacing between the GC doublet and the transcription start site. Such spacing is unusually long for sigma 54-dependent promoters. In rpoN mutants of P. aeruginosa and P. putida a proC'--'lacZ fusion was expressed at wild-type levels, suggesting that sigma 54 RNA polymerase is not involved in proC transcription. The expression of another P. aeruginosa gene, anr (for anaerobic regulation of nitrate respiration and anaerobic arginine degradation), also appeared to be independent of RpoN in Pseudomonas and occurred at a very low level in E. coli. The proC and anr promoters have sequence similarities in addition to the conserved GG--N10--GC motif and may also be related to some alg (alginate) promoters of P. aeruginosa.

	abstract = {Paracoccus denitrificans cytochrome C550 is expressed as a periplasmic holo-protein in Escherichia coli; amino acid substitutions of cysteine residues in the haem-binding motif (Cys-X-X-Cys-His), either together or singly, prevented covalent attachment of haem but not polypeptide translocation into the periplasm. When the three alanine residues at positions -3 to -1 in the native signal-cleavage site were deleted, or alanine at -1 was changed to glutamine, signal cleavage was at alternative sites (after only ten residues in the latter case), but haem attachment still occurred. When the same three alanines were changed to Asp-Glu-Asp, a membrane-associated apo product that had retained the complete signal sequence was detected. These and other results presented here indicate that (i) haem attachment is not required for the apo-cytochrome C550 export to the periplasm; (ii) haem cannot attach to apo-cytochrome C550 when attached to the cytoplasmic membrane, suggesting that signal-sequence cleavage precedes periplasmic haem attachment, which can occur at as few as six residues from the mature N-terminus; and (iii) two cysteines are required for haem attachment, possibly because a disulphide bond is an intermediate. The gene for Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondrial iso-1-cytochrome c was expressed as a holo-protein in E. coli when fused with the signal sequence plus the first 10 residues of the mature cytochrome C550, indicating that the E. coli cellular apparatus for the c-type cytochrome biogenesis has a broad substrate specificity.},

Expression of the gene from which the region coding for the targeting signal had been specifically deleted resulted in formation of apo-protein in the cytoplasms of both organisms. These findings are consistent with haem attachment occurring in the periplasm.

A preliminary multiple sequence alignment is performed using sequence information, which then determines an initial superposition of the structures. A structure comparison algorithm is applied to all pairs of proteins in the superimposed set and a similarity tree calculated. Multiple sequence alignments are then generated by following the tree from the branches to the root. At each branchpoint of the tree, a structure-based sequence alignment and coordinate transformations are output, with the multiple alignment of all structures output at the root. The algorithm encoded in STAMP (STructural Alignment of Multiple Proteins) is shown to give alignments in good agreement with published structural accounts within the dehydrogenase fold domains, globins, and serine proteinases. In order to reduce the need for visual verification, two similarity indices are introduced to determine the quality of each generated structural alignment. Sc quantifies the global structural similarity between pairs or groups of proteins, whereas Pij' provides a normalized measure of the confidence in the alignment of each residue. STAMP alignments have the quality of each alignment characterized by Sc and Pij' values and thus provide a reproducible resource for studies of residue conservation within structural motifs.},

At low concentrations of nitrate, NarK mediates the electrogenic excretion of nitrite rather than nitrate/nitrite exchange.

We have determined the DNA sequence for the promoter region and the proximal 17.1 kb of the cob operon. This sequence includes 20 translationally coupled genes that encode the enzymes involved in parts I and III of the cobalamin biosynthetic pathway. A comparison of these genes with the cobalamin synthetic genes from Pseudomonas denitrificans allows assignment of likely functions to 12 of the 20 sequenced Salmonella genes. Three additional Salmonella genes encode proteins likely to be involved in the transport of cobalt, a component of vitamin B12. However, not all Salmonella and Pseudomonas cobalamin synthetic genes have apparent homologs in the other species. These differences suggest that the cobalamin biosynthetic pathways differ between the two organisms. The evolution of these genes and their chromosomal positions is discussed.},

They are deficient in several diverse metabolic activities, including hydrogen oxidation, nitrate and urea assimilation, denitrification, and various substrate transport systems. Phenotypically similar mutants were identified among hydrogenase-deficient strains of Pseudomonas facilis. The Tn5-labeled hno gene was cloned from a genomic DNA library of A. eutrophus and used to identify the corresponding unimpaired wild-type DNA sequence. The recombinant plasmid pCH148 contained an insert of 12.3 kilobase pairs and was shown to restore the Hno+ phenotype to mutants of A. eutrophus and P. facilis. A cosmid isolated from a DNA library of P. facilis also exhibited intergeneric Hno-complementing activity. The cloned hno loci from both organisms showed DNA homology by Southern blot hybridization. A subclone of pCH148 which contained a 6.5-kilobase-pair insert was constructed. The resulting hybrid, pCH170, not only was able to complement Hno- mutants but also relieved glutamine auxotrophy in NtrA- mutants of enteric bacteria. This suggests that the hno gene product from A. eutrophus is functionally similar to the NtrA protein, which has been identified as a novel sigma factor (sigma 54) of RNA polymerase.},

A Ks (NO3-) of 1 microM was calculated. Nitrate transport exhibited a stringent requirement for Na+. Neither Li+ nor K+ could substitute for Na+. Monensin depressed nitrate transport in a concentration-dependent manner, inhibition being more than 60\% at 2 microM, indicating that the Na(+)-dependence of active nitrate transport relies on the maintenance of a Na+ electrochemical gradient. The operation of an Na+/NO3- symport system is suggested. Nitrite behaved as an effective competitive inhibitor of nitrate transport, with a Ki (NO2-) of 3 microM. The time course of nitrite inhibition of nitrate transport was consistent with competitive inhibition by mixed alternative substrates. Nitrate and nitrite might be transported by the same carrier.},

The time course for the concentration of ferrocytochrome follows the law: formula: (see text), where S is the concentration of donor ferrocytochrome c, So is the initial concentration, t is time, and u1, u2, and u3 are empirical parameters that are constant for a given experiment but depend upon the initial substrate concentration. In particular, all the u1 increase with decreasing initial ferrocytochrome concentration. Saturation of reaction rates at high donor ferrocytochrome concentrations was not observed. The parameter u1 was proportional to the enzyme concentration while u2 and u3 were not. The form of the integrated rate law and the behavior of the u1 impose severe restrictions on possible kinetic schemes for the activity of the enzyme. Contemporary mechanisms that have been proposed for mitochondrial oxidase aa3 are examined and found to be inadequate to explain the reactivity of cytochrome cd. The simplest interpretations of the cytochrome cd data suggest that the enzyme does not bind the ferri and ferro forms of donor cytochromes c with equal affinity and that the enzyme is subject to inhibition by a product of reaction. Eucaryotic horse cytochrome c reacts with the Paracoccus cytochrome cd with 77\% of the activity when Paracoccus cytochrome c550 is used as the electron donor.},

	abstract = {The oxidation-reduction and spectroscopic properties of various forms of nitrous oxide reductase from Pseudomonas stutzeri were investigated. The high-activity form I of the enzyme (purple, 8 Cu, Mr 140,000) was reduced by a large variety of cationic, anionic and photochemically generated agents. The blue form III was the only product found in these experiments under anaerobic conditions. Reductive (dithionite) and oxidative (ferricyanide) titrations showed that the conversion of the purple form I to the blue species III was fully reversible in the absence of dioxygen. Two kinetically different phases of the reaction of form I with a stoichiometric amount of dithionite (1e- -equivalent/Cu) were detected: in the fast phase (seconds), the purple chromophore with lamba max at 540 nm disappeared almost completely, whereas in the slower phase (minutes) the blue species with lambda max around 650 nm was generated. Irrespective of the nature of the reductant the blue species did not react even at large excess of reductant. It was reoxidized by ferricyanide, hydrogen peroxide and nitric oxide. A new, catalytically inactive derivative of nitrous oxide reductase (form V, 2 Cu, Mr 140,000) was isolated from a transposon Tn5-induced mutant with defective chromophore biosynthesis. The pink color of the mutant protein faded almost completely after addition of 0.5e- -equivalent/Cu. In this case no blue species was found, similar to earlier observations for the regenerated, catalytically inactive protein. Varying with the sample and the pH, 50-80\% of the total copper of form I was in an electron-paramagnetic-resonance-(EPR)-silent state as compared to 47\% in the mutant protein. The broad, featureless EPR signal recorded at 9.32 GHz for the blue, reduced form III of nitrous oxide reductase represented approximately 20\% of the total copper. For the blue species no resolution enhancement was achieved at 34 GHz. At this frequency both forms I and V showed similar EPR signals with apparent g-values at 2.16 and 1.99. At 9.32 GHz, form V had an EPR signal with gII at 2.18, AII = 3.55 mT (4 or 5 lines, in contrast to form I) and gI at 2.03. Above 100 K the splitting of the gII region into seven equidistant lines in the EPR signal of the high-activity form I and the hyperfine structure of the perpendicular transition disappeared. Carbon monoxide and nitric oxide, but not nitrous oxide, had marked effects on the spectroscopic properties of the purple form I. Marked effects were also obtained for the exogenous ligands nitrite, azide, cyanate and thiocyanate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

	abstract = {The phototrophic bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides DSM 158 has a periplasmic nitrate reductase which is induced by nitrate and it is not repressed by ammonium or oxygen. In a Tn5 mutant lacking nitrate reductase activity, transposon insertion is localized in a 1.2 kb EcoRI fragment. A 0.6 kb BamHI-EcoRI segment of this region was used as a probe to isolate, from the wild-type strain, a 6.8 kb PstI fragment carrying the putative genes coding for the periplasmic nitrate reductase. In vivo protein expression and DNA sequence analysis reveal the presence in this region of three genes, napABC, probably organized in an operon. These genes are required for nitrate reduction, as deduced by mutational and complementation studies. The napA gene codes for a protein with a high homology to the periplasmic nitrate reductase from Alcaligenes eutrophus and, to a lesser extent, to other prokaryotic nitrate reductases and molybdenum-containing enzymes. The napB gene product has two haem c-binding sites and shows a high homology with the cytochrome c-type subunit of the periplasmic nitrate reductase from A. eutrophus. NAPA and NAPB proteins appear to be translated with signal peptides of 29 and 24 residues, respectively, indicating that mature proteins are located in the periplasm. The napC gene codes for a 25 kDa protein with a transmembrane sequence of 17 hydrophobic residues. NAPC has four haem c-binding sites and is homologous to the membrane-bound c-type cytochromes encoded by Pseudomonas stutzeri nirT and Escherichia coli torC genes. The phenotypes of defined insertion mutants constructed for each gene also indicate that periplasmic nitrate reductase from R. sphaeroides DSM 158 is a dimeric complex of a 90 kDa catalytic subunit (NAPA) and a 15 kDa cytochrome c (NAPB), which receives electrons from a membrane-anchored tetrahaem protein (NAPC), thus allowing electron flow between membrane and periplasm. This nitrate-reducing system differs from the assimilatory and respiratory bacterial nitrate reductases at the level of cellular localization, regulatory properties, biochemical characteristics and gene organization.},

	abstract = {A genome and fatty acid analysis of 16 Pseudomonas stutzeri reference strains having DNA compositions ranging from 62.2 to 65.5 mol\% G+C was performed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of XbaI and SpeI macrorestriction fragments and gas chromatography of total cellular fatty acids. Macrorestriction fragment patterns were evaluated by using previously described algorithms (D. Grothues and B. Tümmler, Mol. Microbiol. 5:2763-2776, 1991), and the results allowed us to subdivide the species into two groups which correlated with G+C content. Two examples of recent strain divergence were observed among clinical isolates, but in general a marked degree of heterogeneity was observed in the macrorestriction fragment patterns, and even phenotypically similar strains produced divergent patterns. While the differences were not sufficiently great to exclude any strain from P. stutzeri, they suggest that recombination and niche-specific selection may be significant factors responsible for generating and maintaining the heterogeneity inherent in the species. Genome sizes were estimated from the sums of SpeI restriction fragment sizes and ranged from 3.4 to 4.3 Mbp; the genome sizes of the low-G+C-content strains (G+C contents, approximately 62 mol\%) were confined to a narrow range between 3.9 and 4.1 Mbp. An examination of the distributions of macrorestriction fragments resulting from digestion with XbaI and SpeI showed that both distributions differed significantly from the expected (random) distribution, suggesting that there is a supragenic level of chromosomal organization. An analysis of fatty acid methyl ester data by using Microbial Identification System software revealed a similar correlation between phenotype and G+C content, indicating that division of the species is possible by the method used in this study.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

	abstract = {Two sensor proteins, NarX and NarQ, mediate nitrate regulation of anaerobic respiratory gene expression. Either of these sensors is sufficient to signal the presence of nitrate to the response regulator protein, NarL, a transcriptional activator and repressor. Two observations suggested the existence of a second response regulator that is also involved in nitrate regulation. First, narL null mutants retain residual nitrate induction of fdnG operon expression; this residual induction is absent in narX narQ double-null strains. Second, nitrate induction of aeg-46.5 operon expression is substantially enhanced in narL null strains (M.H. Choe and W.S. Reznikoff, J. Bacteriol. 173:6139-6146, 1991). We found that this nitrate induction requires either the NarX or the NarQ protein, consistent with the existence of a second response regulator. We designate this second regulator NarP. We isolated insertion mutants that are defective in aeg-46.5 operon expression. These insertions are in the narP gene, which encodes a response regulator that is 44\% identical to the NarL protein. Null alleles of narP abolished aeg-46.5 induction and also eliminated the residual NarL-independent nitrate induction of fdnG operon expression. Both the NarX and NarQ proteins communicate with both the NarP and NarL proteins. We found that the primary signal for NarP-dependent aeg-46.5 operon induction is nitrite rather than nitrate. By contrast, nitrite is a relatively weak signal for NarL-dependent induction. In narX null strains, nitrate was an efficient signal for NarL-dependent induction, and this induction required the NarQ protein. We conclude that, in wild-type strains, the NarQ protein communicates the presence of nitrite to both the NarP and NarL proteins and that the NarX protein inhibits this communication with the NarL protein.},

Three additional open reading frames, nirD, nirE and nirC, were found between nirB and cysG. Potential binding sites on the NirB protein for NADH and FAD, as well as conserved central core and interface domains, were deduced by comparing the derived amino-acid sequence with those of database proteins. A directly repeated sequence, which includes the motif -Cys-Xaa-Xaa-Cys-, is suggested as the binding site for either one [4Fe-4S] or two [2Fe-2S] clusters. The nirD gene potentially encodes a soluble, cytoplasmic protein of unknown function. No significant similarities were found between the derived amino-acid sequence of NirD and either NirB or any other protein in the database.

Static-titration data indicated that the binding process was non-stoicheiometric, with a Hill number of 1.44. Stopped-flow kinetics obtained on the binding of CO to reduced Pseudomonas cytochrome oxidase were biphasic in form; the faster rate exhibited a linear dependence on CO concentration with a second-order rate constant of 2 X 10(4) M-1-s-1, whereas the slower reaction rapidly reached a pseudo-first-order rate limit at approx. 1s-1. The relative proportions of the two phases observed in stopped-flow experiments also showed a dependency on CO concentration, the slower phase increasing as the CO concentration decreased. The kinetics of CO recombination after flash-photolytic dissociation of the reduced Pseudomonas cytochrome oxidase-CO complex were also biphasic in character, both phases showing a linear pseudo-first-order rate dependence on CO concentration. The second-order rate constants were determined as 3.6 X 10(4)M-1-s-1 and 1.6 X 10(4)M-1-s-1 respectively. Again the relative proportions of the two phases varied with CO concentration, the slower phase predominating at low CO concentrations. CO dissociation from the enzyme-CO complex measured in the presence of O2 and NO indicated the presence of two rates, of the order of 0.03s-1 and 0.15s-1.

Previous studies have established that succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) synthesis is elevated by aerobiosis and suppressed during growth with glucose. To examine how the sdhCDAB genes that encode SDH are regulated by changes in the environment, sdh-lacZ fusions were constructed and analysed in vivo following cell growth under a variety of alternative culture conditions. Expression of sdh-lacZ was highest under aerobic conditions and was decreased 10-fold in the absence of oxygen. The fnr and arcA gene products are required for this oxygen control and each acts to repress sdhC-lacZ expression. Expression of sdh-lacZ also varied 10- to 14-fold depending on the type of carbon substrate used or the medium richness. This control was shown to be independent of the crp and fruR gene products, and indicates that some other regulatory element exists in the cell to adjust SDH enzyme levels accordingly. Iron and haem availability affected sdhC-lacZ expression by two- to three-fold. Lastly, sdhC-lacZ expression was shown to vary with the cell growth rate during aerobic and anaerobic conditions.},

The locus comprises the unidirectionally transcribed open reading frames nirFDLGH, downstream of nirMC of the nir gene cluster, and immediately upstream of the norCB operon encoding nitric oxide (NO) reductase (EC 1.7.99.7). Notable sequence relatedness was found between NirF and cytochrome cd1 (NirS), within NirDLGH, and between NirM and NirC, suggesting several gene duplication events in this region. The derived NirF protein (391 amino acids, M(r) 43,137) has 23.8\% identity (51.1\% overall similarity) with NirS, but lacks the N-terminal heme-c-binding domain of NirS. Insertional mutagenesis of the five open reading frames resulted in the loss of respiratory nitrite reductase activity in vivo and in vitro. Mutant strains, when induced with nitrate for denitrification, synthesized a periplasmic cytochrome cd1 lacking heme d1. The defect was caused by the inability of the cell to synthesize heme d1. The nirD locus is proposed to encode a multimeric and multifunctional enzyme complex involved in the synthesis of heme d1. Mutations in nirFDLGH lowered substantially the expression level of norCB. Nir- mutants, unable to generate NO in vivo, provide indirect evidence for an NO sensor and an inducer role of NO for its cognate reductase.},

The polypeptide molecular weight, as judged by sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, is indistinguishable from that of the holoprotein and the chemically prepared apoprotein; this suggests that the N-terminal signal sequence is removed in the mutant as in the wild-type organism. In the presence of levulinic acid, an inhibitor of haem biosynthesis, apocytochrome c550 and aponitrite reductase (cytochrome cd1) accumulated in the periplasm of wild-type cells.

Among the prokaryotic ABC transporters, the cyanobacterial nitrate/nitrite transporter is unique in having a membrane-bound protein NrtA and an NrtA-like extra domain linked to one of the ATP-binding subunits (C-terminal domain of NrtC). Molecular biological, biochemical and physiological studies suggest that NrtA is the substrate-binding protein required for the transport of nitrate/nitrite and that the C-terminal domain of NrtC has a regulatory role. Comparison of the structures of nitrate transporters from eukaryotic and prokaryotic, photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic organisms indicate that the nrt nitrate/nitrite transporter represents a prokaryotic nitrate transporter distinct from the nitrate transporters of eukaryotes.},

	abstract = {The world is experiencing an energy crisis that is restrictive to agricultural requisites production at the same time that food is becoming increasingly short on a global basis. Fertilizers are the most energy demanding of these inputs and have become very expensive and intermittently short in supply with the reduced availability of fossil fuels. They have been indicted, furthermore, as environmental pollutants due to their presumed role in eutrophication and in being a source of excessive NO3-N that may accumulate in some leaf crops and in drinking waters. Exponential growth in fossil fuel consumption cannot continue. Economies can be made in the agricultural sector, which does indeed consume substantial quantities of energy. The energy consumed in this very essential food-producing process, however, is almost insignificant compared with that involved in transport and processing of food beyond the farm and with other energy expenditures in modern society. A shift in priorities will certainly be required in adapting to the real world of the 1970s if man's first need is to be met. Economies in fertilizer use can be made by adherence to known agronomic principles. Savings in fossil fuel energy can probably be effected also in the production of N fertilizer, by far the most fossil-energy-demanding process in the realm of agriculture. Considerable research remains to be done, however, under varied climatic conditions for understanding and controlling processes by which residuals from fertilizers may become environmental pollutants. The various issues in this paper must be resolved promptly in consideration of the now-existing energy crisis and the imminent world food crisis.},

	abstract = {Escherichia coli cells grown anaerobically in the presence of nitrate reduce the nitrate as a terminal electron acceptor in place of molecular oxygen by an induced respiratory-type electron transferring system residing in the inner membrane structure. When oxygen is introduced to a suspension of nitrate-respiring cells, the oxygen is immediately reduced preferentially and the cellular uptake of nitrate ceases abruptly. In contrast, we found that the cells exhibited no oxygen control on uptake of chlorate, a competitive substrate analogue, indicating operation of an oxygen-sensitive transport system specific to nitrate. This was further evidenced by the fact that chlorate inhibition of reduction of nitrate was brought about only when the transport of both chlorate and nitrate was facilitated by the aid of carrier-type chlorate (or nitrate) ionophore. We demonstrated that oxygen inhibition on reduction of nitrate was abolished within the cells treated by octyl glucoside resulting in a removal of permeability barrier specific to nitrate. We conclude that the transient control by molecular oxygen is primarily due to the inhibition of nitrate transport into the cytoplasmic side. Since nitrate induces the nitrate-respiring system, the repression of the nitrate reductase operon by molecular oxygen is consistently interpreted on the basis of the "inducer exclusion mechanism."},

The narX and narL genes encode proteins of molecular weight 67,275 and 23,927, respectively, and are transcribed from a common promoter, narXp, locating within 429 bases upstream of narX. Transcription from narXp is not significantly induced by nitrate under anaerobiosis, whereas transcription from narK promoter, which overlaps narXp region and is transcribed divergently, is fully induced by nitrate. The N-terminal two-thirds of the NarL protein has extensive homology with those of a diverse set of prokaryotic regulatory proteins, including OmpR, PhoB, SfrA, UhpA, CheY, CheB, NtrC, DctD, FixJ, VirG, SpoOF, and SpoOA. A segment locating in the C-terminal half of the NarL protein seems to have potential most likely to form the helix-turn-helix structure characteristic of a class of DNA-binding protein. The protein is considered to play a role as a transcriptional activator of the nitrate reductase operon, narCHJI, and the narK gene. The C-terminal region of the NarX protein also has homology with other regulatory proteins known as counterparts of two-component regulatory systems, such as EnvZ, PhoR, PhoM, CpxA, NtrB, DctB, FixL, and VirA. Presence of two copies of hydrophobic segments in the N-terminal half of the NarX protein suggests the role as a transmembrane receptor sensing nitrate.},

	abstract = {Cytochrome P-450dNIR (P-450dNIR), involved in the fungal denitrification by Fusarium oxysporum, was purified to homogeneity. The cytochrome P-450 (P-450) exhibited a potent nitric oxide (NO) reductase activity to form nitrous oxide (N2O) employing NADH but not NADPH as the sole effective electron donor. The apparent maximum turnover rate against NO was estimated as high as 31,500 min-1. The stoichiometry of the reaction between NO:NADH:N2O was 2:1:1. The reaction required neither an artificial electron-carrying mediator nor other proteinaceous components. An anaerobic incubation of ferric P-450dNIR.NO complex, but not of free ferric P-450dNIR, resulted in rapid reduction of the P-450, indicating that P-450dNIR.NO complex was reduced directly by NADH. Spectral changes during catalytic turnover indicated that decomposition of the ferrous P-450.NO complex might be rate-limiting. The reaction was not inhibited by carbon monoxide at all, suggesting that the free ferrous P-450 is not formed during turnover. On the basis of these results a possible reaction mechanism was considered. The present results demonstrated not only the unique reaction catalyzed by P-450, but also the first P-450-dependent reaction where the electron transport from NAD(P)H to P-450 is not supported by other components. Now that the physiological function of P-450 55A1 (P-450dNIR) has been found, we propose to alter the trivial name to P-450nor.},

On the reduction mode of the methemoglobin M, however, it was classified into three types. 1) Only normal chains were reduced (Hb M Iwate and Hb M Boston). 2) Sequential reduction from normal to abnormal chains occurred (Hb M Milwaukee and Hb M Hyde Park). 3) Normal chains were preferentially reduced, but the reduction of abnormal chains also started at the same rate when the reduction of normal ones had proceeded halfway (Hb M Saskatoon).

This beta-propeller fold has been found in three proteins: that in neuraminidase consists of six beta-sheets while those in methylamine dehydrogenase and galactose oxidase are composed of seven beta-sheets. A model for multisheet packing in the beta-propeller fold is proposed. This model gives both geometrical parameters of the beta-propellers composed of different numbers of sheets and patterns of residue packing at their sheet-to-sheet interfaces. All the known beta-propeller structures have been analyzed, and the observed geometries and residue packing are found to be in good agreement with those predicted by models. It is shown that unusual seven-fold symmetry is preferable to six- or eight-fold symmetry for propeller-like multi-sheet assembly. According to the model, a six-beta-sheet propeller has to have predominantly small residues in the beta-strands closed to its six-fold axis, but no strong sequence constraints are necessary for a seven-fold beta-propeller.},

We also found that both these inhibitors partially inhibited nitrite reduction in this organism. We purified the nitrite reductase of T. pantotropha and found that it was of the cytochrome cd1 type, contrary to the published report of it being a copper-type nitrite reductase. This is of importance since T. pantotropha is capable of aerobic nitrite reduction. The only detectable nitrite reductase in anaerobically or aerobically grown cells is the cd1 type. We also purified a small copper-containing protein, pseudoazurin. Pseudoazurin was found to be capable of donating electrons to the cd1-type nitrite reductase in vitro, and its copper centre was chelated by diethyldithiocarbamate.

Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and DNase I protection assays indicate that where the phosphorylated form of the ArcA protein (ArcA-P) is expected to act as a transcriptional repressor (e.g., of lctPRD and gltA-sdhCDAB), the effect is likely to be mediated by sequestration of cis-controlling transcriptional regulatory elements. In contrast, in the case of cydAB, for which ArcA-P is expected to function as a transcriptional activator, two discrete binding sites have been identified upstream of a known promoter, and activation from these sites is likely to be mediated by a mechanism typical of the type I class of prokaryotic transcriptional activators. An additional ArcA-P binding site has also been located downstream of the known promoter, and a distinct role for this site in the regulation of the cydAB operon during anoxic growth transitions is suggested. These results are discussed within the framework of an overall model of signaling by the Arc two-component signal transduction system in response to changes in aerobiosis.},

	volume = {3},
	issn = {0969-2126},
	doi = {10.1016/s0969-2126(01)00188-5},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The collagenases are members of the family of zinc-dependent enzymes known as the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). They are the only proteinases that specifically cleave the collagen triple helix, and are important in a large number of physiological and pathological processes. Structures are known for the N-terminal catalytic' domain of collagenases MMP-1 and MMP-8 and of stromelysin (MMP-3). This catalytic domain alone, which comprises about 150 amino acids, has no activity against collagen. A second domain, of 200 amino acids, is homologous to haemopexin, a haem-binding glycoprotein.
RESULTS: The crystal structure of full-length MMP-1 at 2.5 A resolution gives an R-factor of 21.7\%. Two domains are connected by an exposed proline-rich linker of 17 amino acids, which is probably flexible and has no secondary structure. The catalytic domain resembles those previously observed, and contains three calcium-binding sites. The haemopexin-like domain contains four units of four-stranded antiparallel beta sheet stabilized on its fourfold axis by a cation, which is probably calcium. The domain constitutes a four-bladed beta-propeller structure in which the blades are scarcely twisted.
CONCLUSIONS: The exposed linker accounts for the difficulty in purifying full-length collagenase. The C-terminal domain provides a structural model for haemopexin and its homologues. It controls the specificity of MMPs, affecting both substrate and inhibitor binding, although its role remains obscure. These structural results should aid the design of site-specific mutants which will reveal further details of the specificity mechanism.},

The health effects of contamination are due to the transformation of nitrates into nitrites in the G.I. tract and possibly the transformation of nitrites into nitrosamines in the stomach. The risk of methemoglobinemia in infants is due to nitrites contained in the water used to reconstitute milk for feeding. There are possible but unproven risks associated with the formation of nitrosamines, i.e. teratogenous and cancer risks. Drinking water standards are only based on the risk of methemoglobinemia, but given the present state of knowledge they appear to be safer in relation to the other potential risks. In the face of the increase in nitrates in ground water and the partially known risks, it appears necessary to try and prevent this type of contamination and inform the persons at risk, such as pregnant women and young mothers. It would also be useful to promote research on the effects of nitrates and nitrites on humans.},

Removal of a putative hairpin-forming structure upstream of the ribosome-binding site increased the yield of the purified protein to approximately 80 mg/l. The recombinant protein is indistinguishable from that purified from its natural host. A primer extension study indicated that the pseudoazurin structural gene (pazS) is under the control of the Fnr/Nnr regulatory system, but no promoter-binding sequence could be recognized.

	abstract = {Mutants of Escherichia coli K12 strain WGAS-GF+/LF+ were selected for their inability to use fumarate as terminal electron acceptor for supporting growth on glycerol or lactate in an atmosphere of H2 plus 5\% CO2. Eighty-three mutants were grouped into seven different categories according to their ability to grow on different media and their ability to produce gas during glucose fermentation. Enzymological and genetic studies indicated that the major class (type I), representing nearly 70\% of the isolates, lacked fumarate reductase and corresponded to the frdA mutants studied previously (Spencer \& Guest, 1973, 1974). Members of a second class (type II) were phenotypically similar to men mutants, blocked in menaquinone biosynthesis. They differed from menA mutants in having lesions in the 44 to 51 min region of the chromosome rather than at 87 min. It was concluded that fumarate reductase and menaquinone are essential for anaerobic growth when fumarate serves as electron acceptor but not when nitrate performs this function. Fumarate reductase and menaquinone are also essential for H2-dependent growth on fumarate. Type III mutants, originally frdB, were designated fnr because they were defective in fumarate and nitrate reduction and impaired in their ability to produce gas. The fnr gene was located at 28-5 min by its cotransducibility with pyrF (5-7 to 9-2\%) and trpA (2-7 to 5-7\%) and the gene order fnr-qmeA-pyrF-trpA was established. It was not possible to assign specific metabolic lesions to the fnr mutants nor to the remaining classes, which all exhibited pleiotropic phenotypes. Nevertheless, the results demonstrate that functional or organizational relationships exist between the fumarate reductase system, nitrate reduction and hydrogen production.},

Comparisons with two similar species, Thiobacillus A2 and Paracoccus denitrificans, showed that the new isolate is significantly different from the other two, and merits separate classification. In view of its ability to oxidize reduced sulphur compounds, and because it is a chain-forming coccus rather than a rod, the new isolate has been given the generic name of Thiosphaera, and the species name pantotropha in recognition of its wide range of possible substrates.,},

In the course of purification, cytochrome cd1 specific activity presented a maximum value of 0.048 units/mg of protein. This periplasmic enzyme is a homodimer and each 60 kDa subunit contains one heme c and one heme d1 as prosthetic moieties, both in a low spin state. Redox potentials of hemes c and d1 were determined at three different pH values (6.6, 7.6 and 8.6) and did not show any pH dependence. The first 20 amino acids of the NH2-terminal region of the protein were identified and the sequence showed 45\% identity with the corresponding region of Pseudomonas aeruginosa nitrite reductase but no homology to Pseudomonas stutzeri and Paracoccus denitrificans enzymes. Spectroscopic properties of Pseudomonas nautica 617 cytochrome cd1 in the ultraviolet-visible range and in electron paramagnetic resonance are described.

	abstract = {Pseudomonas aureofaciens truncates the respiratory reduction of nitrate (denitrification) at the level of N2O. The nitrite reductase from this organism was purified to apparent electrophoretic homogeneity and found to be a blue copper protein. The enzyme contained 2 atoms of copper/85 kDa, both detectable by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The protein was dimeric, with subunits of identical size (40 +/- 3 kDa). Its pI was 6.05. The EPR spectrum showed an axial signal g at 2.21(8) and g at 2.04(5). The magnitude of the hyperfine splitting (A parallel = 6.36 mT) indicated the presence of type 1 copper only. The electronic spectrum had maxima at 280 nm, 474 nm and 595 nm (epsilon = 7.0 mM-1 cm-1), and a broad shoulder around 780 nm. A copper protein of low molecular mass (15 kDa), with properties similar to azurin, was also isolated from P. aureofaciens. The electronic spectrum of this protein showed a maximum at 624 nm in the visible range (epsilon = 2.5 mM-1 cm-1) and pronounced structures in the ultraviolet region. The EPR parameters were g parallel = 2.26(6) and g perpendicular = 2.05(6), with A parallel = 5.8 mT. The reduced azurin transferred electrons efficiently to nitrite reductase; the product of nitrite reduction was nitric oxide. The specific nitrite-reducing activity with ascorbate-reduced phenazine methosulfate as electron donor was 1 mumol substrate min-1 mg protein-1. The reaction product again was nitric oxide. Nitrous oxide was the reaction product from hydroxylamine and nitrite and from dithionite-reduced methyl viologen and nitrite. No 'oxidase' activity could be demonstrated for the enzyme. Our data disprove the presumed exclusiveness of cytochrome cd1 as nitrite reductase within the genus Pseudomonas.},

G. (1988) J. Bacteriol. 170, 4658-4668] and the subunit II of cytochrome-c oxidase (COII). Both types of enzymes possess the CuA binding site. The nosZ genes were identified in cosmid libraries by hybridization with an internal 1.22-kb PstI fragment (NS220) of nosZ from P. stutzeri. The derived amino acid sequences indicate unprocessed gene products of 70084 Da (A. eutrophus) and 70695 Da (P. aeruginosa). The N-terminal sequences of the NosZ proteins have the characteristics of signal peptides for transport. A homologous domain, extending over at least 50 residues, is shared among the three derived NosZ sequences and the CuA binding region of 32 COII sequences. Only three out of nine cysteine residues of the NosZ protein (P. stutzeri) are invariant. Cys618 and Cys622 are assigned to a binuclear center, A, which is thought to represent the CuA site of NosZ and is located close to the C terminus. Two conserved histidines, one methionine, one aspartate, one valine and two aromatic residues are also part of the CuA consensus sequence, which is the domain homologous between the two enzymes. The CuA consensus sequence, however, lacks four strictly conserved residues present in all COII sequences. Cys165 is likely to be a ligand of a second binuclear center, Z, for which we assume mainly histidine coordination. Of 23 histidine residues in NosZ (P. stutzeri), 14 are invariant, 7 of which are in regions with a degree of conservation well above the 50\% positional identity between the Alcaligenes and Pseudomonas sequences. Conserved tryptophan residues are located close to several potential copper ligands. Trp615 may contribute to the observed quenching of fluorescence when the CuA site is occupied.},

Mutant strain MK201 overproduced cytochrome c552 about fourfold by comparison with the wild type, but possessed an in vitro functional cytochrome cd1. Mutant strain MK202 lacked cytochrome cd1 and, simultaneously, had low amounts of cytochrome c552 and the split alpha-peak c-type cytochrome. Strain MK203 synthesized nitrite reductase defective in the heme d1 prosthetic group. Irrespective of these biochemically distinct Nir- phenotypes, all mutants preserved the nitric oxide-reducing capability of the wild type. The mutant characteristics demonstrate that cytochrome cd1 is essential for nitrite respiration of P. stutzeri and establish the presence of a nitric oxide-reducing system distinct from cytochrome cd1.

	abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) reductase is an integral membrane component of the anaerobic respiratory chain of Pseudomonas stutzeri that transforms nitrate to dinitrogen (denitrification). The enzyme catalyzes the reduction of NO to nitrous oxide. The structural genes for the NO reductase complex, norC and norB, were sequenced and their organization established by primer extension and Northern blot analysis. The norCB genes encoding the cytochrome c and cytochrome b subunits of the enzyme are contiguous and transcribed as a single 2.0-kb transcript. The promoter region has a canonical recognition motif for the transcriptional activator protein Fnr, centered at -40.5 nucleotides from the initiation site of transcription. No similarity of the derived gene products to known cytochromes of b- or c-type was found in a data bank search. Post-translational processing of the two subunits was limited to the removal of the terminal methionine to leave an N-terminal serine in either subunit. The mature cytochrome c subunit (16508Da, 145 residues) is predicted to be a bitopic protein with a single membrane anchor. The mature cytochrome b subunit (53006Da, 473 residues) is a putatively polytopic, strongly hydrophobic membrane-bound protein with 12 potential transmembrane segments. Several histidine and proline residues were identified with potentially structural and/or functional importance. Mutational inactivation of NO reductase by deletion of norB or the norCB genes affected strongly the in vivo activity of respiratory nitrite reductase (cytochrome cd1), but to a much lesser extent the expression level of this enzyme. In turn, mutational inactivation of the structural gene for cytochrome cd1, nirS, or loss of in vivo nitrite reduction by mutation of the nirT gene, encoding a presumed tetraheme cytochrome, lowered the expression level of NO reductase to 5-20\%, but hardly its catalytic activity. The cellular concentration of NO reductase increased again on restoration of nitrite reduction in the nirS::Tn5 mutant MK202 by complementation with nirS or with the heterologous nirK gene, encoding the Cu-containing nitrite reductase from Pseudomonas aureofaciens. Thus, NO may be required as an inducer for its own reductase. Our results show that the nitrite-reducing system and the NO-reducing system are not operating independently from each other but are interlaced by activity modulation and regulation of enzyme synthesis.},

The N2O reductase shares with cytochrome c oxidase the CuA center as a structurally novel metal site. The cytochrome b subunit of NO reductase has a striking conservation of heme-binding transmembrane segments versus the subunit I of cytochrome c oxidase. Another putative denitrification gene product shows structural relation to the subunit III of the oxidase. N2O reductase and NO reductase may be ancestors of energy-conserving enzymes of the heme-copper oxidase superfamily. More than 30 genes for denitrification are located in a {\textgreater} 30-kb cluster in Pseudomonas stutzeri, and comparable gene clusters have been identified in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Paracoccus denitrificans.

	abstract = {The Escherichia coli transcription factor FNR regulates expression of genes required for the metabolic switch between aerobic and anaerobic respiration. In order to investigate how FNR controls transcription of its target operons, DNA binding was examined for both the wild-type (WT) FNR protein and an altered function FNR* protein (DA154) that exhibits enhanced activity in the presence of oxygen both in vivo and in vitro, apparently due to the fact that DA154 is able to dimerize to a greater extent than WT FNR. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays, using a consensus symmetrical FNR target site, revealed that both DA154 and WT FNR gave rise to protein-DNA complexes of indistinguishable electrophoretic mobilities. In addition, an estimate of the molecular weight from the mobility of the DA154-DNA complex indicated that both mutant and WT FNR were dimeric when bound to DNA. Under the same binding conditions, DA154 showed an observed constant of approximately 3 x 10(8) M-1 for the consensus symmetrical target site. In addition, the results of DNA binding competition assays provided evidence that DA154 was a site-specific DNA binding protein, since this mutant protein bound to the consensus symmetrical target site with approximately 40-fold and 250-fold higher affinity than a natural target site from the nar promoter or a non-specific DNA target, respectively. Electrophoretic mobility shift DNA bending assays demonstrated protein-induced DNA bending by both DA154 and WT FNR. In addition, in vitro transcription assays using an FNR-dependent variant of the lac P1 promoter demonstrated levels of transcription activation by DA154 comparable to those observed in vivo. These results provide several new insights into how FNR functions to activate transcription of target genes.},

However, a two-electron reduction of the NO ligand to give an intermediate that reacts with a second NO to give N2O and H2O appears more likely. Conversion of NO to N2O is favored by low levels of both NO and O2, higher NO levels can inhibit both cytochrome c oxidase and NO reductase activities.

	abstract = {The structures of methanol dehydrogenase (MEDH) from two closely related methylotrophic bacteria, Methylophilus methylotrophus and W3A1, have been determined at 2.6-A resolution. The molecule, a quinoprotein of molecular mass of about 138 kDa, contains two heavy (H) and two light (L) subunits of unknown sequence and two molecules of noncovalently associated pyrroloquinoline quinone. The two enzymes crystallize isomorphously in space group P2(1) with one H2L2 heterotetramer in the asymmetric unit. The electron density map of the M. methylophilus enzyme was obtained by multiple isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering and improved by solvent leveling and electron density averaging. For model building, the amino acid sequence of MEDH from Paracoccus denitrificans for the H subunit and from Methylobacterium extorquens AM1 for the L subunit were used to represent the unknown amino acid sequence. At the present time, 579 and 57 amino acid residues for the large and small subunits, respectively, have been fitted into the map. The phases for MEDH from M. methylophilus were used directly to analyze the W3A1 structure, and both structures were refined to R-factors (where R = sigma[Fo-Fc[/sigma Fo) of 0.277 and 0.266, respectively. The L subunit contains a long alpha-helix and an extended N-terminal segment, both lying on the molecular surface of the H subunit. The H subunit contains eight antiparallel beta-sheets, each consisting of four strands arranged topologically like the letter W. The eight Ws are arranged circularly, forming the main disc-shaped body of the subunit, with some short helices and loops connecting the consecutive Ws, as well as some excursions within and between some of the Ws. The pyrroloquinoline quinone prosthetic group is located in the central channel of the large subunit near the surface of the molecule. The topology of the eight-W folding unit is similar to those of the six- and seven-W folding units previously reported for three other proteins, neuraminidase, methylamine dehydrogenase, and galactose oxidase.},

The deduced amino acid sequence has enabled the structure of the enzyme to be refined at 2.4 angstrom resolution against X-ray data collected on a Hamlin area detector. The structure was refined using the programs PROFFT and X-PLOR with several model building step interspersed. The final model contains two heavy chains (571 amino acids), two light chains (69 amino acids), two molecules of pyrroloquinoline quinone, two Ca2+ and 521 solvent molecules. Each half molecule contains four disulfide linkages and four cis peptides. One of the disulfides is formed from two adjacent cysteine residues linked by a trans peptide which creates a novel eight-membered ring. The heavy subunit is an 8-fold beta-propeller, each "blade" of which is a four-stranded antiparallel twisted beta-sheet. The light chain is an elongated subunit stretching across the surface of the heavy subunit, with residues 1 to 32 containing four beta-turns and residues 33 to 62 forming a helix; however, it neither interacts with the active site, nor the other HL dimer and its functional role is obscure. Around the 8-fold beta-propeller there is a repeating pattern of tryptophan residues located in the outer strand of seven of the eight beta-leaflets, each packed between adjacent leaflets. Each of these tryptophan residues is centered in the beta-strand and participates in the main chain hydrogen bonding of the sheet. Five of the seven tryptophan residues have closely similar interactions with the adjacent beta-leaflet including stacking of the tryptophan indole rings against a peptide plane and formation of a hydrogen bond from NE1 of the indole ring to a main-chain carbonyl. This repeating pattern is conserved over a number of MEDH sequences. The PQQ is located on the pseudo 8-fold rotation axis of the heavy subunit, in a funnel-shaped internal cavity, sandwiched between the indole ring of Trp237 and the two sulfur atoms of the Cys103-Cys104 vicinal disulfide. A hexacoordinate Ca2+ is bound in the active site by one nitrogen and five oxygen ligands, three from the PQQ and the others from two protein side-chains. In the active site an isolated solvent molecule is bound to the O5 of PQQ and to a nearby aspartate side-chain; its position may be the binding site for methanol. The aspartate might than serve as a general base for proton abstraction from the substrate hydroxyl. The C5 atom of PQQ could be activated by electrophilic catalysis by a nearby argenine side-chain or by the calcium ion bound to PQQ.},

Its extracellular domains are homologous with and thought to be structurally similar to an antibody Fab fragment. Despite the biological importance of the TCR and the ease of bacterial expression of antibody fragments, there are only few reports of TCR-fragment expression in E. coli. In order to understand the difficulties of expressing correctly folded TCR fragments in E. coli, we have characterized the expression behavior of single-chain Fv analogs of three different TCRs (scTCR). All of them can be folded into the correct conformation in the periplasm of E. coli, yet the extent of correct folding varies greatly. In order to overcome the folding problems of some of the scTCRs, we have developed a system with enhanced in vivo folding capability based on the simultaneous induction of the heat-shock response and over-expression of the E. coli disulfide isomerase DsbA at low temperature. We present a model describing the folding of the scTCRs in the periplasm of E. coli and possible points of folding assistance. The role of the periplasm as an independent folding compartment is emphasized and the existence of a general periplasmic chaperone is postulated. We have also shown that a bivalent scTCR, dimerized in vivo with helix-turn-helix modules, can be expressed in a correctly folded form.},

	abstract = {Escherichia coli is an organism that synthesizes 5-aminolevulinate (ALA), the first committed compound of the heme biosynthetic pathway, from glutamate (C-5 pathway) as opposed to glycine and succinyl CoA (C-4 pathway). While regulation of the C-4 pathway is generally acknowledged to occur at the level of formation of ALA, the mode of regulation of the C-5 pathway is currently unclear. Here we have examined one aspect of regulation of heme synthesis in E. coli: the role of the end product, heme, as a feed-back regulator of ALA production. By using plasmid-encoded ALA synthase and/or cytochrome b5 expressed in a wild type E. coli strain, it was possible to determine the role that the proposed regulatory heme pool plays in the regulation of ALA and heme production. Expression of rat-soluble cytochrome b5 results in an increase of cellular heme, indicating that the cell responds to this foreign "heme sink" by producing more heme even though the cytochrome does not participate directly in normal cellular regulation. Accumulation of pathway intermediates does not occur under these conditions. Expression of plasmid-encoded mouse ALA synthase results in increased cellular heme production as well as the accumulation of pathway intermediates either in the presence or absence of plasmid encoded cytochrome b5. These data support a regulatory scheme where the heme biosynthetic pathway in this C-5 organism is regulated at the level of ALA production in part by cellular heme content.},

The homologous activator FNR of Escherichia coli, when introduced into an anr mutant of P. aeruginosa, could functionally replace ANR for anaerobic growth on nitrate but not for anaerobic induction of arginine deiminase. In an FNR-positive E. coli strain, the ANR-dependent promoter of the arcDABC operon, which encodes the enzymes of the arginine deiminase pathway, was not expressed. To analyse systematically these distinct induction patterns, a lacZ promoter-probe, broad-host-range plasmid containing various -40 regions (the ANR/FNR recognition sequences) and -10 promoter sequences was constructed. These constructs were tested in P. aeruginosa and in E. coli expressing either ANR or FNR. In conjunction with the consensus -10 hexamer of E. coli sigma 70 RNA polymerase (TATAAT), the consensus FNR site (TTGAT ..... ATCAA) was recognized efficiently by ANR and FNR in both hosts. By contrast, when promoters contained the Arc box (TTGAC .... ATCAG), which is found in the arcDABC promoter, or a symmetrical mutant FNR site (CTGAT .... ATCAG), ANR was a more effective activator than was FNR. Conversely, an extended 22 bp, fully symmetrical FNR site allowed better activation with FNR than with ANR. Combination of the arc promoter -10 sequence (CCTAAT) with the Arc box or the consensus FNR site resulted in good ANR-dependent expression in P. aeruginosa but gave practically no expression in E. coli, suggesting that RNA polymerase of P. aeruginosa differs from the E. coli enzyme in -10 recognition specificity. In conclusion, ANR and FNR are able to activate the RNA polymerases of P. aeruginosa and E. coli when the -40 and -10 promoter elements ae identical or close to the E. coli consensus sequences.},

We suggest that some feature of the surface-exposed turn around residue 159 is recognised by RNA polymerase during transcription activation at these promoters. Mutations at position 52 increase CRP activity and reverse the effects of H159L and delta 159, most likely by creating a new contact with RNA polymerase. However this new contact only gives increased expression when the CRP binding site is located 41 1/2 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site and fails to reverse the effects of H159L and delta 159 at promoters where the CRP site is located further upstream. To explain our results we propose that the two surface-exposed turns around residues 52 and 159 contain elements that are potential RNA polymerase docking sites: in the CRP dimer these two active patches are located on adjacent faces of different subunits. FNR, a related transcription activator, contains amino acid sequences homologous to the CRP sequence around position 52. Mutations in this zone (from residues 81-88 in FNR) reduce expression from an FNR-dependent promoter without stopping FNR binding to its target. This defines a patch on FNR, which is homologous to the CRP surface-exposed loop around position 52, which is involved in transcription activation, most likely by contacting RNA polymerase.},

The absorption spectra of both reconstituted enzymes are essentially identical to that of the original nitrite reductase. These results further substantiate the novel dione structure of heme d1 as proposed. The loss of NO2- reducing activity in the absence of heme d1 and its restoration by addition of heme d1 provides further evidence that heme d1 plays a key role in the conversion of NO2- to NO and N2O.},

Denitrifying isolates from water column and sediment environments were also screened; several isolates from an intertidal microbial mat reacted with the NiR antiserum. Activity assays for NiR in polyacrylamide gels demonstrated that strains with apparently very similar NiR proteins did not react with the antiserum. These results imply that the NiR protein is more variable even among closely related strains than previously suspected. A DNA probe for a 721 bp region of the NiR structural gene was obtained by PCR amplification of P. stutzeri (ATCC 14405) DNA and used to screen denitrifying strains and isolates. The probe hybridized with a greater variety of strains than did the antiserum, implying that the DNA probe may be a more broadly useful and functional probe in environmental samples, whilst the NiR antiserum is nearly strain- or, at most, species-specific. Limits for detection of the enzyme and gene in seawater were estimated and NiR DNA was detected in DNA extracted from natural seawater. The hybridization data imply that in the order of 1-10 in 1000 cells in natural seawater possess homology with the NiR gene probe.},

	abstract = {The nature of the axial ligation to heme iron has been suggested to be the major determinant of the oxidation-reduction potential of a particular cytochrome, but natural cytochromes that vary significantly in E'm invariably differ from one another in many ways. We proposed to clarify this issue by engineering many different ligation patterns within the same basic molecule, mitochondrial cytochrome c. Since many of the potentially informative substitutions require non-coded amino acids, semisynthesis was the approach we chose, and solid-phase peptide synthesis was used to make a set of nin 39-residue peptides that have been incorporated by autocatalytic fragment religation into the structure of horse cytochrome c. An additional two analogues modified at this position were made by chemical modification of the whole protein. As well as looking at the effect on reduction potential, we examined the effect of varying the ligand sphere on the efficiency of the autocatalytic fragment religation reaction, on the conformation of cytochrome c, on its spectroscopic properties, and in promoting electron transfer between heme c and other redox centers. Substitute residues were chosen to put sulfur, selenium, oxygen, and nitrogen, or even no ligating atom at all in the place of methionine sulfur. We found both subtle and dramatic alterations in spectral properties, which were informative about changes in internal structure and stability brought about by the modifications and which may be useful in identifying novel natural ligation patterns. An unexpected finding was that alanine 80 cytochrome c acquires a hemoglobin-like spectrum, and binds O2 most effectively. Reduction potential changes of greater than 300 mV with nitrogen, greater than 400 mV with oxygen, and greater than 300 mV with thiol sulfur ligation were observed, confirming that variation of the ligand sphere is indeed the most effective way in which the protein coat may modulate the potential of the redox center it encloses. Finally, we obtained more evidence that this axial ligand plays an active role in electron transfer and discovered that histidine could be even more effective in this role.},

These plasmids were subjected to in vitro mutagenesis, and beta-galactosidase activities were determined in transformed strains after aerobic and anaerobic growth. A single base-pair change in the Fnr box, a sequence which is highly conserved in all Fnr-dependent promoters, essentially abolished anaerobic induction of expression. Primer extension analysis located the transcription start site 57 bp upstream from the narG translation start site and placed the Fnr box at a position centred between -41 and -42 bases from the transcription start site. The position of the Fnr box relative to the transcription start site was critical for anaerobic induction of expression. The deletion of 2 bp or addition of 4, 6, 10, 14, 20, 22, 28, 30, and 40 bp immediately downstream from the Fnr box abolished anaerobic induction. Sequence changes between the Fnr box and the transcription start site had different effects, depending upon the region mutagenized. Base changes immediately downstream from the Fnr box, including bases -20 to -29, did not lead to any decrease in anaerobic induction of expression, but in most instances resulted in increased expression. Base changes further downstream prevented anaerobic induction of expression and suggested the requirement for a -10 hexamer which is partially homologous to the -10 consensus sequence for sigma 70-specific promoters of E. coli.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

A nos-coding region of ca. 8 kilobases was cloned by plasmid integration and excision. It comprised nosZ, the structural gene for the copper-containing enzyme nitrous oxide reductase, genes for copper chromophore biosynthesis, and a supposed regulatory region. The location of the nosZ gene and its transcriptional direction were identified by using a series of constructs to transform Escherichia coli and express nitrous oxide reductase in the heterologous background. Plasmid pAV5021 led to a nearly 12-fold overexpression of the NosZ protein compared with that in the P. stutzeri wild type. The complete sequence of the nosZ gene, comprising 1,914 nucleotides, together with 282 nucleotides of 5'-flanking sequences and 238 nucleotides of 3'-flanking sequences was determined. An open reading frame coded for a protein of 638 residues (Mr, 70,822) including a presumed signal sequence of 35 residues for protein export. The presequence is in conformity with the periplasmic location of the enzyme. Another open reading frame of 2,097 nucleotides, in the opposite transcriptional direction to that of nosZ, was excluded by several criteria from representing the coding region for nitrous oxide reductase. Codon usage for nosZ of P. stutzeri showed a high G + C content in the degenerate codon position (83.9\% versus an average of 60.2\%) and relaxed codon usage for the Glu codon, characteristic features of Pseudomonas genes from other species. E. coli nitrous oxide reductase was purified to homogeneity. It had the Mr of the P. stutzeri enzyme but lacked the copper chromophore.},

	abstract = {The three-dimensional structure of quinoprotein methylamine dehydrogenase from Thiobacillus versutus has been determined at 2.25 A resolution by a combination of multiple isomorphous replacement, phase extension by solvent flattening and partial structure phasing using molecular dynamics refinement. In the resulting map, the polypeptide chain for both subunits could be followed and an X-ray sequence was established. The tetrameric enzyme, made up of two heavy (H) and two light (L) subunits, is a flat parallellepiped with overall dimensions of approximately 76 x 61 x 45 A. The H subunit, comprising 370 residues, is made up of two distinct segments: the first 31 residues form an extension which embraces one of the L subunits; the remaining residues are found in a disc-shaped domain. This domain is formed by a circular arrangement of seven topologically identical four-stranded antiparallel beta-sheets, with approximately 7-fold symmetry. In spite of distinct differences, this arrangement is reminiscent of the structure found in influenza virus neuraminidase. The L subunit consists of 121 residues, out of which 53 form a beta-sheet scaffold of a central three-stranded antiparallel sheet flanked by two shorter two-stranded antiparallel sheets. The remaining residues are found in segments of irregular structure. This subunit is stabilized by six disulphide bridges, plus two covalent bridges involving the quinone co-factor and residues 57 and 107 of this subunit. The active site is located in a channel at the interface region between the H and L subunits, and the electron density in this part of the molecule suggests that the co-factor of this enzyme is not pyrrolo quinoline quinone (PQQ) itself, but might be instead a precursor of PQQ.},

The vector was derived from suicide vector pGRPd1, which was equipped with the lacZ gene encoding beta-galactosidase. The reporter gene was found to be a successful screening marker for the discrimination between plasmid integrant strains and mutant strains which had lost the plasmid after homologous recombination. Suicide vectors pGRPd1 and pRVS1 were used in gene replacement techniques for the construction of mutant strains with multiple mutations in the cycA, moxG, and cycB genes encoding the periplasmic cytochromes c550, c551i, and c553i, respectively. Southern analyses of the DNA and protein analyses of the resultant single, double, and triple mutant strains confirmed the correctness of the mutations. The wild type and mutant strains were all able to grow on succinate and choline chloride. In addition, all strains grew on methylamine and displayed wild-type levels of methylamine dehydrogenase activities. cycA mutant strains, however, showed a decreased maximum specific growth rate on the methylamine substrate. The wild-type strain, cycA and cycB mutant strains, and the cycA cycB double mutant strain were able to grow on methanol and showed wild-type levels of methanol dehydrogenase activities. moxG mutant strains failed to grow on methanol and had low levels of methanol dehydrogenase activities. The maximum specific growth rate of the cycA mutant strain on methanol was comparable with that of the wild-type strain. The data indicate the involvement of the soluble cytochromes c in clearly defined electron transport routes.},

	abstract = {By using the moxF gene encoding the large fragment of methanol dehydrogenase as a probe, a downstream linked chromosomal fragment was isolated from a genomic bank of Paracoccus denitrificans. The nucleotide sequence of the fragment was determined and revealed the 3' part of moxF, four additional open reading frames, and the 5' part of a sixth one. The organization and deduced amino acid sequences of the first three frames downstream from moxF were found to be largely homologous to the moxJ, moxG, and moxI gene products of Methylobacterium extorquens AM1. Directly downstream from these three genes, a new mox gene was identified. The gene is designated moxR. By using the suicide vector pGRPd1, the moxJ, moxG, and moxR genes were inactivated by the insertion of a kanamycin resistance gene. Subsequently, suicide vector pRVS1 was used to replace the marker genes in moxJ and moxG for unmarked deletions made in vitro. As a result, the three insertion strains as well as the two unmarked mutant strains were unable to grow on methanol, even in the presence of pyrroloquinoline quinone. Growth on succinate and on methylamine was not affected. In all five mutant strains, synthesis of the large subunit of methanol dehydrogenase and of inducible cytochrome c553i was observed. The moxJ and moxG insertion mutant strains were unable to synthesize both the cytochrome c551i and the small subunit of methanol dehydrogenase, and this lack of synthesis was attended by the loss of methanol dehydrogenase activity. The moxJ deletion mutant strain partly synthesized the latter two proteins, cytochrome c551i. Partial synthesis of the small subunit of methanol dehydrogenase observed with the latter strain was attended by a corresponding extent of methanol dehydrogenase activity. The moxR insertion mutant strain was shown to synthesize cytochrome c551i as well as the large and small subunits of methanol dehydrogenase, but no methanol dehydrogenase activity was observed. The results show that periplasmic cytochrome c551i is the moxG gene product and the natural electron acceptor of methanol dehydrogenase in P. denitrificans. In contrast to earlier suggestions, this cytochrome was found to be different from membrane-bound cytochrome c552. In addition, it is demonstrated that moxI encodes the small subunit of methanol dehydrogenase. It is suggested that MoxJ is involved in the assemblage of active methanol dehydrogenase in the periplasm and, in addition, that MoxR is involved in the regulation of formation of active methanol dehydrogenase.},

A mutation in the nnr gene had a negative effect on the expression of nitrite and nitric oxide reductase. Synthesis of membrane bound nitrate reductase, of nitrous oxide reductase, and of the cbb3-type cytochrome c oxidase were not affected by mutation of this gene.

	abstract = {Citrate and iron have to enter only the periplasmic space in order to induce the citrate-dependent iron(III) transport system of Escherichia coli. The five transport genes fecABCDE form an operon and are transcribed from fecA to fecE. Two genes, termed fecI and fecR, that mediate induction by iron(III) dicitrate have been identified upstream of fecA. The fecI gene encodes a protein of 173 amino acids (molecular weight, 19,478); the fecR gene encodes a protein of 317 amino acids (molecular weight, 35,529). Chromosomal fecI::Mu d1 mutants were unable to grow with iron(III) dicitrate as the sole iron source and synthesized no FecA outer membrane receptor protein. Growth was restored by transformation with plasmids encoding fecI or fecI and fecR. FecA and beta-galactosidase syntheses under transcription control of the fecB gene (fecB::Mu d1) were constitutive in fecI transformants and were regulated by iron(III) dicitrate in fecI fecR transformants. The amino acid sequence of the FecI protein contains a region close to the carboxy-terminal end for which a helix-turn-helix motif is predicted, which is typical for DNA-binding regulatory proteins. The FecI protein was found in the membrane, and the FecR protein was found in the periplasmic fraction. It is proposed that the FecR protein is the sensor that recognizes iron(III) dicitrate in the periplasm. The FecI protein activates fec gene expression by binding to the fec operator region. In the absence of citrate, FecR inactivates FecI. The lack of sequence homologies to other transmembrane signaling proteins and the location of the two proteins suggest a new type of transmembrane control mechanism.},

MADH and its electron acceptor amicyanin are indispensable for growth on methylamine. At least three different cytochromes c and two types of cytochrome c oxidase, cytochromes aa3 and cbb3, have previously been proposed to participate in the electron transfer pathways from methylamine to oxygen. In this study, participation of both cytochrome c oxidases and of the quinol oxidase (cytochrome bb3) has indeed been confirmed by analysis of a series of oxidase mutants. Interestingly, a P. denitrificans cytochrome c oxidase mutant (delta aa3/cbb3) retains the capacity to oxidise methylamine. It is demonstrated that the oxidation of the cytochrome c pool in this mutant does not proceed via an alternative cytochrome c oxidase, but rather via an 'uphill' electron transfer through the bc1 complex to ubiquinone, driven by the membrane potential. The subsequent oxidation of ubiquinol proceeds via the only remaining terminal oxidase, the bb3-type quinol oxidase.},

Both patches were previously thought to be involved in electron transfer. 1H-NMR spectroscopy revealed only minor changes in the three-dimensional structure of the mutants compared to wild-type azurin. Observed changes in midpoint potentials could be attributed to electrostatic effects. The slow relaxation phase observed in temperature-jump experiments carried out on equilibrium mixtures of wild-type azurin and cytochrome c551 was definitively shown to be due to a conformational relaxation involving His35.

Nitrite-dependent N2O formation and/or cell growth during the anaerobic culture was not affected by further addition of ammonium ions but was suppressed by respiration inhibitors such as rotenone or antimycin, suggesting that denitrification plays a physiological role in respiration. Dissimilatory nitrite reductase and nitric oxide reductase (Nor) activities could not be detected in cell extracts of the denitrifying cells. The Nor activity was purified and found to depend upon two isoenzymes of Cytochrome P-450nor (P-450nor), which were designated P-450nor1 and P-450nor2. These isozymes differed in the N-terminal amino acid sequence, isoelectric point, specificity to the reduced pyridine nucleotide (NADH or NADPH), and the reactivity to the antibody to P-450nor of F. oxysporum. the difference between the specificities to NADH and NADPH suggests that P-450nor1 and P-450nor2 play different roles in anaerobic energy acquisition.},

In other bacteria, different regulatory cascades with other underlying principles can be observed. Regulation of anabolism in response to O2 availability is important, too. It is caused by different requirements of cofactors or coenzymes in aerobic and anaerobic metabolism and by the requirement for different O2-independent biosynthetic routes under anoxia. The regulation mainly occurs at the transcriptional level. In E. coli, 4 global regulatory systems are known to be essential for the aerobic/anaerobic switch and the described hierarchy. A two-component sensor/regulator system comprising ArcB (sensor) and ArcA (transcriptional regulator) is responsible for regulation of aerobic metabolism. The FNR protein is a transcriptional sensor-regulator protein which regulates anaerobic respiratory genes in response to O2 availability. The gene activator FhlA regulates fermentative formate and hydrogen metabolism with formate as the inductor. ArcA/B and FNR directly respond to O2, FhlA indirectly by decreased levels of formate in the presence of O2. Regulation of nitrate/nitrite catabolism is effected by two 2-component sensor/regulator systems NarX(Q)/NarL(P) in response to nitrate/nitrite. Co-operation of the different regulatory systems at the target promoters which are in part under dual (or manifold) transcriptional control causes the expression according to the hierarchy. The sensing of the environmental signals by the sensor proteins or domains is not well understood so far. FNR, which acts presumably as a cytoplasmic 'one component' sensor-regulator, is suggested to sense directly cytoplasmic O2-levels corresponding to the environmental O2-levels.},

From the enzymes of the anaerobic electron transfer chain from glycerol-3-P to fumarate only the expression of glycerol-3-P dehydrogenase (Freedberg WB, Lin ECC (1973) J Bacteriol 115:816-823), but not that of fumarate reductase required cAMP.

It is concluded that cAMP in anaerobic growth like in aerobic growth acts as the effector of CRP and that catabolite repression plays an important regulatory role in anaerobic catabolism. The Fnr protein was present in constant amounts (0.06 mg/g cellular protein) and in constant molar mass (Mr 30,000) in aerobically and in anaerobically grown bacteria.

The nir promoter is activated by NarL in response to nitrate and nitrite and activated by NarP in response to nitrate but not nitrite. The effects of point mutations suggest that NarL and NarP both bind to the same target, which is a pair of heptamer sequences organized as an inverted repeat, centred 69 1/2 bp upstream of the transcript startpoint. The nrf promoter can be activated by either NarP or NarL in response to nitrite but is repressed by NarL in response to nitrate. Mutational analysis of the nrf promoter has been exploited to corroborate the location of the -10 hexamer and the FNR-binding site, and to find the sites essential for nitrite-dependent activation and nitrate-dependent repression. Optimal activation by NarP or NarL in response to nitrite requires an inverted pair of heptamer sequences, similar to that found at the nir promoter, but centred 74 1/2 bp upstream from the transcript start. NarL-dependent repression by nitrate is due to two heptamer sequences that flank the FNR-binding sequence. We conclude that NarL and NarP bind to the same heptamer sequences, but that the affinities for the two factors vary from site to site.},

These enzymes include cytochrome o oxidase (cyoABCDE) and cytochrome d oxidase (cydAB), used during aerobic cell growth, and a fumarate reductase (frdABCD), dimethyl sulfoxide/trimethylamine oxide reductase (dmsABC), and nitrate reductase (narGHJI), used during anaerobic respiratory conditions. To determine how different levels of oxygen affect the expression of each operon, strains containing cyo-lacZ, cyd-lacZ, frdA-lacZ, dmsA-lacZ, and narG-lacZ fusions were grown in continuous culture at various degrees of air saturation. The basal-level expression of the anaerobic respiratory genes, frdABCD, dmsABC, and narGHJI, occurred when the air saturation of the medium was above 20\%; as the saturation was reduced to below 10\% (ca. 2\% oxygen), the expression rapidly increased and reached a maximal level at 0\% air. In contrast, cyoABCDE gene expression was lowest under anaerobic conditions while cyd-lacZ expression was about 40\% of its maximum level. When the oxygen level was raised into the microaerophilic range (ca. 7\% air saturation) cyd-lacZ expression was maximal while cyo-lacZ expression was elevated by about fivefold. As the air level was raised to above 20\% saturation, cyd-lacZ expression fell to a basal level while cyo-lacZ expression was increased to its maximum level. The role of the Fnr and ArcA regulatory proteins in this microaerophilic control of respiratory gene expression was documented: whereas Fnr function as an aerobic/anaerobic switch in the range of 0 to 10\% air saturation, ArcA exerted its control in the 10 to 20\% range. These two transcriptional regulators coordinate the hierarchial control of respiratory pathway gene expression in E. coli to ensure the optimal use of oxygen in the cell environment.},

USA 86:1954-1957, 1989) and have undertaken a more extensive survey of genes under RpoN control. Strains of P. aeruginosa that carry an insertionally inactivated rpoN gene were constructed and shown to be nonmotile because of the inability of these mutants to synthesize flagellin. The mutation in rpoN had no effect on expression of extracellular polypeptides, outer membrane proteins, and the alginate capsule. However, the rpoN mutants were glutamine auxotrophs and were defective in glutamine synthetase, indicating defects in nitrogen assimilation. In addition, the P. aeruginosa rpoN mutants were defective in urease activity. These findings indicate that the sigma factor encoded by the rpoN gene is used by P. aeruginosa for transcription of a diverse set of genes that specify biosynthetic enzymes, degradative enzymes, and surface components. These rpoN-controlled genes include pili and flagella which are required for full virulence of the organism.},

Sequencing upstream of norCB, the structural genes for NO reductase, in the denitrifying bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.3, we have identified a gene, designated nnrR, which encodes a protein that is a member of the cyclic AMP receptor family of transcriptional regulators. Insertional inactivation of nnrR prevents growth on nitrite, as well as the reduction of nitrite and NO, but has no effect on reduction of nitrate or photosynthetic growth. By using nirK-lacZ and norB-lacZ fusions, we have shown that NnrR is a positive transcriptional regulator of these genes. nnrR is expressed at a low constitutive level throughout the growth of R. sphaeroides 2.4.3. These results show that NnrR is not a global regulator but is instead a regulator of genes whose products are directly responsible for production and reduction of NO. Evidence is also presented suggesting that an NnrR homolog may be present in the nondenitrifying bacterium R. sphaeroides 2.4.1. The likely effector of NnrR activity, as determined on the basis of work detailed in this paper and other studies, is discussed.},

We have cloned the gene nirK, which encodes the copper-type nitrite reductase from a denitrifying variant of Rhodobacter sphaeroides, strain 2.4.3. The deduced open reading frame has significant identity with other copper-type nitrite reductases. Analysis of the promoter region shows that transcription initiates 31 bases upstream of the translation start codon. The transcription initiation site is 43.5 bases downstream of a putative binding site for a transcriptional activator. Maximal expression of a nirK-lacZ construct in 2.4.3 requires both a low level of oxygen and the presence of a nitrogen oxide. nirK-lacZ expression was severely impaired in a nitrite reductase-deficient strain of 2.4.3. This suggests that nirK expression is dependent on nitrite reduction. The inability of microaerobically grown nitrite reductase-deficient cells to induce nirK-lacZ expression above basal levels in medium unamended with nitrate demonstrates that changes in oxygen concentrations are not sufficient to modulate nirK expression.},

The phylogenetic classification of the P-450 (P-450nor) into the group of bacterial P-450s along with its involvement in the anaerobic process are of evolutional interest. The corresponding gene, CYP 55, of the fungus Fusarium oxysporum was isolated and sequenced. The P-450nor gene contained 7 introns that consisted of 49 to 55 bp. The presence of the introns suggested that horizontal transfer of the gene from bacteria to the fungus, if it has occurred, was an early event in evolution. Besides a TATA box, several inverted repeats were found in the 5'-upstream flanking region. One inverted repeat exhibited the same sequence as the binding site of FNR (fumarate and nitrate reduction), a DNA-binding, O2 (dioxygen)-sensor protein that positively regulates expressions of many hypoxic genes in Escherichia coli and other bacteria. The result suggested that the expression of P450nor is regulated in response to oxygen tension by an FNR-like system. Northern blot analyses showed that both nitrate and nitrite are the actual inducers of P-450nor and that its expression is predominantly regulated at the transcriptional level. These results raise the interesting possibility that the expression of the fungal denitrification system is regulated, as in the case of bacterial nitrate respiration, by a set of mechanisms, i.e., a combination of an FNR-like system and a system responding to nitrate/nitrite.},

The m.c.d. spectra in the range 1000-2000 nm contain no charge-transfer bands arising from low-spin ferric haem d1, a chlorin. New optical transitions in the region 700-850 nm were found for the cyanide adduct of haem d1. The g-values of haem d1 in the native enzyme are 2.51, 2.43 and 1.71, suggesting co-ordination by two histidine ligands in the oxidized state. There is clear evidence in the e.p.r. data of an interaction between the c and d1 haem groups. This is not apparent in the optical spectra. The results are interpreted in terms of haem groups that are remote from each other, their interaction being mediated through protein conformational changes.

In the nitrogen-fixing soybean symbiont Bradyrhizobium japonicum, two functional, highly conserved rpoN genes (rpoN1 and rpoN2) were identified and sequenced. The two predicted B. japonicum RpoN protein sequences were 87\% identical, and both showed different levels of homology to the RpoN proteins of other bacteria. Downstream of rpoN2 (but not of rpoN1), two additional open reading frames were identified that corresponded to open reading frames located at similar positions in Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas putida. Both B. japonicum rpoN genes complemented the succinate- and nitrate-negative phenotypes of a Rhizobium meliloti rpoN mutant. B. japonicum strains carrying single or double rpoN mutations were still able to utilize C4-dicarboxylates as a carbon source and histidine, proline, or arginine as a nitrogen source, whereas the ability to assimilate nitrate required expression of at least one of the two rpN genes. In symbiosis both rpoN genes could replace each other functionally. The rpoN1/2 double mutant induced about twice as many nodules on soybeans as did the wild type, and these nodules lacked nitrogen fixation activity completely. Transcription of a nifH'-'lacZ fusion was not activated in the rpoN1/2 mutant background, whereas expression of a fixR'-'lacZ fusion in this mutant was affected only marginally. By using rpoN'-'lacZ fusions, rpoN1 expression was shown to be activated at least sevenfold in microaerobiosis as compared with that in aerobiosis, and this type of regulation involved fixLJ. Expression of rpoN2 was observed under all conditions tested and was increased fivefold in an rpoN2 mutant. The data suggested that the rpoN1 gene was regulated in response to oxygen, whereas the rpoN2 gene was negatively autoregulated.},

Ten negatively charged residues located on the surface of NIR were replaced independently by alanine or serine. All the altered NIRs showed CD spectra and optical spectra identical to those of wild-type NIR, suggesting that all the replacements caused no gross change in the overall structure or in the environment of type 1 copper site. Kinetic analysis of electron transfer between pseudoazurin and altered NIRs revealed that the replacement of Glu-118, Glu-197, Asp-201, Glu-204, or Asp-205 by Ala caused a significant increase in the Km value for pseudoazurin compared with that of wild-type NIR. Furthermore, the simultaneous replacement of three of these residues (Glu-118, Glu-197, and Asp-201) caused a further increase in the Km value. These results suggested that the negatively charged residues are involved in electrostatic interaction with pseudoazurin. Kinetic analyses of the altered NIRs (E118A, E197A, or D201A) with altered pseudoazurins (K10A, K57A, or K77A) implicate specific pairs of the charged residues that are involved in electrostatic interaction between NIR and pseudoazurin.},

Crystallographic analysis shows that NIR is a trimer composed of three identical subunits, each of which contains one atom of type I copper and one atom of type II copper, and that the ligands to the type I and type II copper atoms are the same as those of the Achromobacter cycloclastes NIR. An efficient NIR expression-secretion system in Escherichia coli was constructed and used for site-directed mutagenesis. An NIR mutant with a replacement of the type II copper ligand, His135, by Lys still retained a type II copper site as well as a type I copper atom, but it completely lost nitrite-reducing activity as measured with methyl viologen as an electron donor. On the other hand, another mutant with a replacement of the type I copper ligand, Met150, by Glu contained only a type II copper atom, but it still retained significant nitrite-reducing activity with methyl viologen. When pseudoazurin was used as an electron donor for the reaction, however, Met150Glu failed to catalyze the reduction of nitrite. Kinetic analysis of the electron transfer between NIR and pseudoazurin revealed that the electron-transfer rate between Met150Glu and pseudoazurin was reduced 1000-fold relative to that of wild-type NIR.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

	abstract = {Lysis of spheroplasts made from denitrification-adapted Paracoccus denitrificans released a soluble nitrous oxide reductase which was assayed spectrophotometrically under anaerobic conditions by following the oxidation of methyl or benzyl viologen cation radical upon reduction of N2O to N2. Other classes of reductants so far tested, including dithionite, could not substitute for viologen dyes. Viologen dyes, therefore, afford the first practical assay for this previously elusive enzyme of denitrifying bacteria. The assay is specifically an in vitro assay, because the dyes cannot couple with intracellular nitrous oxide reductase. The enzyme exhibited simple saturation kinetics with respect to both N2O and reduced viologen dye. The Km for N2O was about 5 microM at 22 degrees C and pH 7.1 and the apparent Km for reduced benzyl and methyl viologen was 0.9 and 0.5 microM, respectively. Both dyes afforded the same Vmax value. Oxidized viologen dyes were not inhibiting to 1 mM nor was N2 to 1 atm. In fresh lysates, Vmax was about 1.2 mumol of N2O X min-1 x mg of protein-1 or about twice that for intact cells or spheroplasts utilizing yeast extract or lactate. Enzyme activity was observed to be labile in crude preparations under anaerobic conditions. Nitrous oxide reductase was inhibited by acetylene, CO, azide, and cyanide with Ki values of 28, 3.5, 0.35, and 0.045 microM, respectively. All showed noncompetitive inhibition with respect to N2O.},

Expression of nitrate reductase, nitrite reductase (cytochrome cd1), and N2O reductase was controlled by discrete oxygen levels and by the nature of the nitrogenous oxide available for respiration. N2O reductase was synthesized constitutively at a low level; for enhanced expression, oxygen concentrations were required to decrease below 5 mg of O2 per liter. The threshold values for synthesis of nitrate reductase and cytochrome cd1 in the presence of nitrate were ca. 5 and ca. 2.5 mg of O2 per liter, respectively. With nitrous oxide as the respiratory substrate, nitrite reductase was again the most sensitive to oxygen concentration; however, thresholds for all denitrification enzymes shifted to lower oxygen levels. Whereas the presence of nitrate resulted in maximum expression and nearly uniform induction of all reductases, nitrite and nitrous oxide stimulated preferably the respective enzyme catalyzing reduction. In the absence of a nitrogenous oxide, anaerobiosis did not induce enzyme synthesis to any significant degree. The accumulation of nitrite seen during both the aerobic-anaerobic and anaerobic-aerobic transition phases was caused by the differences in onset or cessation of synthesis of nitrate and nitrite reductases and an inhibitory effect of nitrate on nitrite reduction.},

Fluorescence immunolocalization, cofractionation with mitochondrial marker enzymes, and cytochromes provided evidence that the denitrifying enzymes are co-purified with mitochondria. Respiratory substrates such as malate plus pyruvate, succinate, and formate were effective donors of electrons to these activities in the mitochondrial fractions. Moreover, nitrite and nitrate reduction were shown to be coupled to the synthesis of ATP with energy yields (P:NO3- or P:2e ratios) of 0.88 to 1.4, depending upon whether malate/pyruvate or succinate were provided as substrates. Nitrate or nitrite reductase activity was inhibited by inhibitors such as rotenone, antimycin A, and thenoyltrifluoroacetone.

The enzyme seemed to consist of two subunits with almost the same M(r) value of 41,800 and contains two atoms of copper per subunit. The electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum showed that both type 1 and type 2 copper centers are present in the protein, whereas the visible absorption spectrum exhibited a sole and strong absorption maximum at 595 nm, causing a blue but not green color. The reaction product due to the Cu-NiR was mainly nitric oxide (NO), whereas a stoichiometric amount of nitrous oxide (N2O) was formed when cytochrome P-450nor was further added to the assay system. Therefore, the denitrifying (N2O forming) nitrite reductase activity that we had detected in the cell-free extract of the denitrifying cells (Shoun, H., and Tanimoto, T. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 11078-11082) could be reconstituted upon combination of the purified Cu-NiR and P-450nor. The Km for nitrite and specific activity at pH 7.0 were estimated as 49 microM and 447 mumol NO.min-1.mg protein-1, respectively. Its activity was strongly inhibited by cyanide, carbon monoxide, and diethyldithiocarbamate, whereas enormously restored by the addition of cupric ions. An azurin-like blue copper protein (M(r) = 15,000) and a cytochrome c were also isolated from the same fungus, both of which together with cytochrome c of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae were effective in donating electrons to the fungal Cu-NiR. The result suggested that the physiological electron donor of the Cu-NiR is the respiratory electron transport system. The intracellular localization of Cu-NiR was investigated, and it was suggested that the Cu-NiR localizes in an organelle such as mitochondrion. These findings showed the identity in many aspects between the fungal nitrite reductase and bacterial dissimilatory Cu-NiRs. This is the first isolation of dissimilatory NiR from a eukaryote.},

	abstract = {Electron transfer within cytochrome cd1 from Thiosphaera pantotropha was investigated by the technique of pulse radiolysis. The reduction of the heme centers in this nitrite reductase occurred in two phases as judged from kinetic difference spectra. In the faster phase, radiolytically generated N-methylnicotinamide (NMA) radicals selectively reduced the c-heme of the enzyme. From the absorbance increase at 420 nm, a characteristic of formation of the ferrousc-heme, the second-order rate constant for this electron transfer process was estimated to be 3.8 x 10(9) M-1 s-1 at pH 7.0. In the slower phase, a decrease of absorption around 420 and 550 nm, corresponding to a reoxidation of the c-heme, was accompanied by an increase of absorption around 460 and 640 nm, characteristic of formation of the reduced d1-heme. This indicated that an intramolecular electron transfer from the c-heme to the d1-heme occurred. The first-order rate constant of this process was calculated to be 1.4 x 10(3) s-1 at pH 7.0 and was independent of the enzyme concentration. In the presence of nitrite the interheme electron transfer rate was not affected, but on a time scale of seconds a new species associated with the d1-heme, having an absorption maximum at 640 nm, was detected and is proposed to reflect ligand binding to this heme. These results suggest the role of the c-heme as the electron acceptor site in cytochrome cd1 and in mediating the electron transfer to the catalytic site of the enzyme. Moreover, the fast interheme electron transfer rate argues against this process being the rate determining step in catalysis.},

A single base pair transition within the protein binding site affected the oxygen-dependent expression of puf in vivo and the formation of DNA-protein complexes in vitro. The data suggest that the formation of specific DNA-protein complexes is involved in the oxygen-dependent regulation of the puf promoter.

	abstract = {The dissimilatory nitrite reductase (cytochrome c,d1) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa was observed at pH 7.5 to catalyze nitrosyl transfer (nitrosation) between [15N]nitrite and several N-nucleophiles or H2 18O, with rate enhancement of the order of 10(8) relative to analogous chemical reactions. The reducing system (ascorbate, N,N,N',N'-tetramethylphenylenediamine) could reduce nitrite (but not NO) enzymatically and had essentially no direct chemical reactivity toward nitrite or NO. The N-nitrosations showed saturation kinetics with respect to the nucleophile and, while exhibiting Vmax values which varied by about 40-fold, nevertheless showed little or no dependence of Vmax on nucleophile pKa. The N-nitrosations and NO-2/H2O-18O exchange required the reducing system, whereas NO/H2O-18O exchange was inhibited by the reducing system. NO was not detected to serve as a nitrosyl donor to N-nucleophiles. These and other kinetic observations suggest that the enzymatic nitrosyl donor is an enzyme-bound species derived from reduced enzyme and one molecule of nitrite, possibly a heme-nitrosyl compound (E-FeII X NO+) for which there is precedence. Nitrosyl transfer to N-nucleophiles may occur within a ternary complex of enzyme, nitrite, and nucleophile. Catalysis of nitrosyl transfer by nitrite reductase represents a new class of enzymatic reactions and may present another example of electrophilic catalysis by a metal center. The nitrosyl donor trapped by these reactions is believed to represent an intermediate in the reduction of nitrite by cytochrome c,d1.},

The rate of reduction of NO to N2O was considerably lower than the rate of reduction of nitrite to N2O and might be zero. The N2O produced in a system containing [15N]nitrite and natural NO was more highly enriched in 15N than was the NO pool and, in this regard, closely resembled the enrichment of the nitrite pool. The amount of 14N in the NO pool changed little, if any, as the result of enzymatic processes. For the enzyme, free NO seems not to be an intermediate between nitrite and N2O, just as was found by this laboratory for certain intact denitrifying bacteria. The results are consistent with reduction of nitrite to enzyme-bound NO, which can partition between release and further reduction.},

	abstract = {In the facultative anaerobe Escherichia coli, the transcription factor FNR (fumarate nitrate reduction) regulates gene expression in response to oxygen deprivation. To investigate how the activity of FNR is regulated by oxygen availability, two mutant proteins, DA154 and LH28-DA154, which have enhanced in vivo activity in the presence of oxygen, were purified and compared. Unlike other previously examined FNR preparations, the absorption spectrum of LH28-DA154 had two maxima at 324 nm and 419 nm, typical of iron-sulfur (Fe-S)-containing proteins. Consistent with these data, metal analysis showed that only the LH28-DA154 protein contained a significant amount of iron and acid-labile sulfide, and, by low temperature EPR spectroscopy, a signal typical of a [3Fe-4S]+ cluster was detected. The LH28-DA154 protein that contained the Fe-S cluster also contained a higher proportion of dimers and had a 3- to 4-fold higher apparent affinity for the target DNA than the DA154 protein. In agreement with this, we found that when the LH28-DA154 protein was treated with an iron chelator (alpha,alpha'-dipyridyl), it lost its characteristic absorption and the apparent affinity for DNA was reduced 6-fold. However, increased DNA binding and the characteristic absorption spectrum could be restored by in vitro reconstitution of the Fe-S center. DNA binding of the LH28-DA154 protein was also affected by the redox state of the Fe-S center, since protein exposed to oxygen bound 1/10th as much DNA as the protein reduced anaerobically with dithionite. The observation that DNA binding is enhanced when the Fe-S center is reduced indicates that the redox state of the Fe-S center affects the DNA-binding activity of this protein and suggests a possible mechanism for regulation of the wild-type protein.},

The results from biochemical analysis, site-directed mutagenesis, and electrospray mass spectrometry support the binuclear model. Two cysteines, two histidines, and one methionine are the major ligands of two coppers. Substitution of these residues results in either a complete loss of color or dramatic changes in the absorbance spectrum. In contrast, substitution of the invariant glutamate residue, which is located between the copper-binding cysteines, leads to a minor perturbation of the optical spectrum.},

The amino acid sequences deduced from the nirDLGH genes were homologous to each other. A gene, designated nirJ, which encodes a protein of 387 amino acids, showed partial identity with each of the nirDLGH genes. The nirE gene encodes a protein of 279 amino acids homologous to S-adenosyl-L-methionine:uroporphyrinogen III methyltransferase from other bacterial strains. In addition, NirE shows 21.0\% identity with NirF in the N-terminal 100-amino-acid residues. A gene, designated nirN, encodes a protein of 493 amino acids with a conserved binding motif for heme c (CXXCH) and a typical N-terminal signal sequence for membrane translocation. The derived NirN protein shows 23.9\% identity with nitrite reductase (NirS).

Molecular phylogenetic relationships of strain THI 011T to Thiobacillus versutus and members of the genus Paracoccus were elucidated by comparing 16S rRNA gene sequences. Binary sequence comparisons showed that strain THI 011T was most related to Paracoccus aminophilus, at a similarity level of 97.0\%, and T. versutus was most similar to Paracoccus denitrificans, at a level of 99.1\%.

	abstract = {The nitric oxide reductase (NOR) from Pseudomonas stutzeri is a cytochrome bc complex which shows on SDS/PAGE two subunits with apparent molecular masses of 17 kDa and 38 kDa. Two other species of approximately 45 kDa and 74-78 kDa represent the undissociated enzyme complex and an aggregate of the cytochrome b subunit, respectively. The cytochrome b subunit is highly hydrophobic and results in aberrant electrophoretic mobility. The stability of the enzyme in various detergents and at different pH was investigated. The highest specific activity of 60 mumol NO min-1 mg-1 protein was obtained after electrophoresis in the presence of laurylpropanediol-3-phosphorylcholine ether. Purified NOR contained cardiolipin, phosphatidylglycerol, and phosphatidylethanolamine, the latter as the major component. A phospholipid was required for high catalytic activity with either cardiolipin or phosphatidylglycerol increasing the activity of the enzyme as isolated by a factor of up to 5. Free fatty acids inhibited NOR, with cis-9-octadecenoic acid (oleic acid) showing the most pronounced effect. Certain detergents substituted for the phospholipid requirement of NOR. The enzyme, as isolated, in 0.1\% Triton X-100, 20 mM Tris/HCl pH 8.5, exhibited a complex set of EPR resonances at low magnetic field, with a prominent peak at g 6.34 resulting from Fe(III) high-spin cytochrome b. The second prominent feature arose from a low-spin Fe(III) heme center with strong lines at apparent g values of 3.02 and 2.29, and a broad resonance at g approximately 1.5 which we assigned to the cytochrome c component of the enzyme. From spin quantitation and computer simulations of the various EPR signals a ratio close to 1:1 for the low-spin/high-spin heme centers in NOR was estimated. Shifting the pH from 8.5 to 5.0, replacing Triton X-100 by other detergents, or adding soybean phospholipids to the protein, led to pronounced changes of the EPR signals in the g = 6 region. In contrast, the strong inhibitor oleic acid did not cause significant spectral changes. NOR which had been reduced by L-ascorbate/phenazine methosulfate prior to incubation with its substrate NO gave the characteristic Fe(II) nitrosyl triplet centered at g approximately 2.01, with a hyperfine splitting of 1.70 mT. In the absence of dioxygen, NOR was quantitatively reduced by either sodium dithionite, or photochemically with deazaflavin and oxalate; the enzyme was reoxidizable by ferricyanide in a fully reversible reaction. Spectroelectrochemical oxidoreductive titrations gave E'o (versus standard hydrogen electrode) = +322 mV for the cytochrome b and +280 mV for the cytochrome c component.},

The Fnr-binding site of P6 and the -35 hexamer sequence of P6A are shared between the promoters. Inactivation of P6A, through introduction of a -10 hexamer mutation, resulted in enhanced anaerobic induction of operon expression. The dependence on the ArcA (aerobic respiration control regulator) and Fnr transcription factors for anaerobic induction was tested for several focA-lacZ and pfl-lacZ gene fusions. Anaerobic induction became more dependent on Fnr in derivatives lacking a functional P6A promoter compared with wild-type constructs. Moreover, aerobic expression of the focA gene was reduced by the p6A mutation, as was the dependence on ArcA for anaerobic induction. Inactivation of P6 severely reduced Fnr-dependent anaerobic induction, in accord with previous findings. Transcription analyses demonstrated that a mutation in the -10 hexamer sequence of either P6A or P6 did not adversely affect transcription from the remaining promoter.

Its derived gene product (275 amino acids, M(r) = 30,554) shows similarity to the NtrC protein family of transcriptional activators. Deletion-replacement mutagenesis of the nirQ gene resulted in the simultaneous loss of nitrite reduction and NO reduction in vivo. However, both reductases were still synthesized, with only nitrite reductase being active in vitro. NO reductase was overproduced by a factor of about 2. Our results indicate that the systems for nitrite reduction and NO reduction are functionally coupled.},

The results indicate approximately one 3Fe and three or four [4Fe-4S]2+,1+ centers/molecule of isolated enzyme. The magnetic circular dichroism spectra and magnetization characteristics show the oxidized and reduced 3Fe and [4Fe-4S] centers to be electronically analogous to those in bacterial ferredoxins. The form and spin quantitation of the EPR spectra from [4Fe-4S]1+ centers in the reduced enzyme were found to vary with the conditions of reduction. For the fully reduced enzyme, the EPR spectrum accounted for between 2.9 and 3.5 spins/molecule, and comparison with partially reduced spectra indicates weak intercluster magnetic interactions between reduced paramagnetic centers. In common with other Fe-S proteins, the 3Fe center was not extruded intact under standard conditions. The results suggest that nitrate reductase is the first example of a metalloenzyme where enzymatic activity is associated with a form that contains an oxidized 3Fe center. However, experiments to determine whether or not the 3Fe center is present in vivo were inconclusive.},

To understand this unusual electron transfer pathway the gene required for cyt c2-independent growth of R.capsulatus was sought using chromosomal libraries derived from a cyt c2- mutant of this species to complement a Ps- cyt c2- mutant of R.sphaeroides to Ps+ growth. The complementing 1.2 kbp DNA fragment contained a gene, cycY, encoding a novel membrane-associated c-type cytochrome, cyt cy, based on predicted amino acid sequence, optical difference spectra and SDS-PAGE analysis of chromatophore membranes. The predicted primary sequence of cyt cy is unusual in having two distinct domains, a hydrophobic amino-terminal region and a carboxyl-terminus with strong homology to cytochromes c. A cyt cy- mutant of R.capsulatus remains Ps+ as does the cyt c2- mutant. However, a mutant lacking both cyt c2 and cy is Ps-, and can be complemented to Ps+ by either cyt c2 or cyt cy. These findings demonstrate that each of the cytochromes c2 and cy is essential for photosynthesis only in the absence of the other. Thus, two distinct electron transfer pathways, unrecognized until now, operate during photosynthesis in R.capsulatus under appropriate conditions, one via the soluble cyt c2 and the other via the membrane-associated cyt cy.},

Reaction of the enzyme with NO2- in the presence of NO increases the amount of N2O product significantly, while trapping the NO product as nitrosylhemoglobin or rapid removal of NO by sparging results in no detectable N2O production. Reaction of the enzyme with 15NO2- in the presence of 14NO results in rapid formation of the mixed isotope product (14N, 15N)O in ca. 45\% yield. In contrast, the presence or absence of NO has no effect on N2O production by a prototypical heme cd1-containing nitrite reductase. These results are consistent with formation of a labile Cu(+)-NO+ species in the copper enzyme, which normally decomposes to NO. Production of N2O requires that the released NO must rebind to the enzyme to combine with a second NO2- or a species derived therefrom.},

'ArcB (a genetically truncated ArcB missing the two transmembrane segments on the N-terminal end) and ArcA were purified from overproducing cells.

Under such conditions, for a given time period the amount of ArcA phosphorylated was proportional to the concentration of 'ArcB. Thus, 'ArcB acted as a kinase for ArcA.

Recent evidence arguing against a Cu(III)-Cu(I) couple implies the existence of a second redox-active site proposed to involve pyrroloquinoline quinone or a tyrosine radical. We now report the crystal structure of galactose oxidase at 1.7 A resolution. This reveals a unique structural feature at the copper site with a novel thioether bond linking Cys 228 and Tyr 272 in a stacking interaction with Trp 290. We propose that these molecular components stabilize the protein free-radical species essential for catalysis and thus provide a 'built-in' secondary cofactor.

Chem. 260, 14626-14629] that can be classified as an amicyanin on the basis of its ability to accept electrons from methylamine dehydrogenase. The amino acid composition and sequence of the 10 N-terminal residues of this protein have been determined. From these data, it is evident that amicyanin is structurally distinct from azurins as it contains no disulfide bond and an N-terminal sequence that is completely different from the highly conserved N-terminal azurin sequences. Dialysis of reduced amicyanin against potassium cyanide resulted in a nearly quantitative yield of apoamicyanin. Amicyanin and apoamicyanin exhibit fluorescence emission maxima at 314 nm when excited at 280 nm. Addition of 6 M guanidine hydrochloride shifts these emission maxima to 350 nm. The fluorescence intensity of apoamicyanin is 10-fold greater than that of amicyanin. Addition of copper to the apoprotein caused a stoichiometric quenching of fluorescence and restoration of visible absorbance with no concomitant change in absorbance at 280 nm. At least one cysteine residue, which reacts with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) in apoamicyanin, does not react in the holoprotein, even in the presence of 6 M guanidine hydrochloride. Reductive and oxidative titrations of amicyanin indicate that it is a one-electron carrier. This amicyanin is also able to accept electrons from the methylamine dehydrogenase isolated from bacterium W3A1, which is taxonomically very different from P. denitrificans.},

	abstract = {The cytochrome oxidase/nitrite reductase of Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been purified to homogeneity as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. When this "homogeneous" protein is subjected to electrophoretic titration curve analysis in ampholines or to isoelectric focusing in immobilized pH gradient gels it is resolved into several bands, each of which possesses the olive-green color of the holoenzyme. Although the patterns of resolution replicate for a given enzyme preparation differences occur among different preparations. Furthermore, storage for several months at -20 degrees C leads to an increase in the number of isoelectrophoretic forms. All preparations, however, have two primary bands, one with a pI of 6.97 and the other of 7.02. Both these bands possess significant cytochrome oxidase activity after elution from the gels. When each of the primary bands is eluted and again subjected to isoelectric focusing under the same conditions as before, each band interconverts into two bands with pIs of 6.97 and 7.02. The addition of the ligand cyanide to the holoenzyme produces a shift in the pI of the two bands to pIs 7.04 and 7.12 while the addition of nitrite shifts some of the band at pI 6.97 into that at pI 7.02. The heme d1-containing dipeptide of the enzyme, produced by treatment with subtilisin, also exhibits considerable heterogeneity upon electrophoretic titration curve analysis and by isoelectric focusing in immobiline gels. Possible explanations for the observed isoelectrophoretic behavior in terms of protein conformation and heme chemistry are discussed.},

	abstract = {Oxidized Pseudomonas cytochrome oxidase (ferrocytochrome c-551:oxidoreductase; EC 1.9.3.2), digested with subtilisin in the absence and presence of KCN, produces discrete, high molecular weight fragments. The presence of KCN alters the rate of this fragmentation but does not change the nature of the fragments. When digested in the absence of KCN, the oxidase gives a major product (A) which is enzymatically active and has an apparent Mr = 58,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In the presence of KCN, the major product (B) has Mr = 48,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis but with gel permeation high performance liquid chromatography it has an apparent Mr = 92,000. This implies that product B is dimeric, as is the parent enzyme which has Mr = 110,000 by high performance liquid chromatography. Absorption spectra of product B, isolated by gel filtration, show that it contains only the heme d1 moiety. The digestion time course indicates that the rate at which several minor products are formed is also dependent on the absence or presence of KCN. These observations suggest that the binding of KCN to the heme centers induces a conformational change in the enzyme so that the heme c-containing portion of the protein, which is at one end of the intact enzyme, can be removed without disrupting the integrity of the heme d1-containing portion.},

	abstract = {The structural gene for the respiratory nitrous-oxide reductase from Paracoccus denitrificans has been cloned using a probe derived from the structural gene, nosZ, for this enzyme from Pseudomonas stutzeri. The cloned gene could be expressed surprisingly well (presumably yielding an apo-protein) using an expression vector in Escherichia coli. Sequencing the nosZ gene from P. denitrificans has shown that the periplasmic nitrous-oxide reductase of this organism is highly similar in sequence to previously derived primary sequences for the enzyme from three other organisms. As with the other reductases, an unusually long signal sequence is deduced and a common motif of GXXRRXXLG near the beginning of this sequence is present. The results of N-terminal sequencing of the mature nitrous-oxide reductase from the closely related organism Thiosphaera pantotropha indicate that processing of the P. denitrificans precursor occurs between amino acids at positions 57 and 58. The predicted signal peptide is therefore of the same length and of similar overall structure to that previously described for the P. denitrificans methylamine dehydrogenase small subunit (MauA). The P. denitrificans sequence for the mature nitrous-oxide reductase reduces from 14 to 11 and 6 to 4, respectively, the number of conserved histidine and methionine residues compared to previous sequences. Three cysteine and four tryptophan residues, previously identified as conserved amongst nitrous-oxide reductases, are found in the Paracoccus enzyme. A comparison of the sequence of the C-terminal region of the nitrous-oxide-reductase sequence with that for the CuA region of subunit II of the cytochrome aa3 from P. denitrificans reveals considerable sequence similarities. Upstream of the structural gene for nosZ are sequences TTGAAGCTTAACCAG (centred at position -21 with respect to the start codon) and CCCGGTGGTCATCAAG (centred at position -126). Although both could be FNR (ANR) boxes, the latter is far more probable to have this role because only it is likely to be upstream of a promoter site. This is the first indication at the DNA sequence level for the existence of this regulatory system in P. denitrificans. Analysis of the flanking DNA sequences revealed reading frames upstream and downstream of the nosZ gene showing similarity to the nosR and nosD genes, respectively, of Pseudomonas species. An S30 in vitro transcription/translation system was developed for P. denitrificans which permitted the expression of the cloned gene for nitrous-oxide reductase and which will be of general value in other studies of this organism.},

	abstract = {The spectroscopic and structural properties of the His93Tyr variant of horse heart myoglobin have been studied to assess the effects of replacing the proximal His residue of this protein with a tyrosyl residue as occurs in catalases from various sources. The variant in the ferric form exhibits electronic spectra that are independent of pH between pH 7 and 10, and it exhibits changes in absorption maxima and intensity that are consistent with a five-coordinate heme iron center at the active site. The EPR spectrum of the variant is that of a high-spin, rhombic system similar to that reported for bovine liver catalase. The 1D 1H-NMR spectrum of the variant confirms the five-coordinate nature of the heme iron center and exhibits a broad resonance at 112.5 ppm that is attributable to the meta protons of the phenolate ligand. This result indicates that the new Tyr ligand flips at a significant rate in this protein. The thermal stability of the Fe(III) derivative is unchanged from that of the wild-type protein (pH 8) while the midpoint reduction potential [-208 mV vs SHE (pH 8.0, 25 degrees C)] is about 250 mV lower. The three-dimensional structure of the variant determined by X-ray diffraction analysis confirms the five-coordinate nature of the heme iron center and establishes that the introduction of a proximal Tyr ligand is accommodated by a shift of the F helix (residues 88-99) in which this residue resides away from the heme pocket. Additional effects of this change are small shifts in the positions of Leu29, a heme propionate, and a heme vinyl group that are accompanied by altered hydrogen bonding interactions with the heme prosthetic group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

	abstract = {In order to define the interaction domain on Rhodobacter sphaeroides cytochrome c2 for the photosynthetic reaction center, positively charged lysine amino groups on cytochrome c2 were modified to form negatively charged (carboxydinitrophenyl)- (CDNP-) lysines. The reaction mixture was separated into several different fractions by ion-exchange chromatography on (carboxymethyl)cellulose. Tryptic digests of these fractions were analyzed by reverse-phase peptide mapping to determine the lysines that had been modified. Fraction A was found to consist of a mixture of singly labeled derivatives modified at lysine-35, -88, -95, -97, and -105 and several other unidentified lysines comprising 32\% of the total. Although it was not possible to resolve these derivatives, all of the identified lysines are located on the front surface of cytochrome c2 near the heme crevice. The second-order rate constant for the reaction of native cytochrome c2 with reaction centers was 2.0 X 10(8) M-1 s-1, while that for fraction A was 20-fold less, 1.0 X 10(7) M-1 s-1. This suggests that lysines surrounding the heme crevice of cytochrome c2 are involved in electrostatic interactions with carboxylate groups at the binding site of the reaction center. The reaction rates of horse heart cytochrome c derivatives modified at single lysine amino groups with trifluoroacetyl or trifluoromethylphenylcarbamoyl were also measured. Modification of lysine-8, -13, -27, -72, -79, and -87 surrounding the heme crevice significantly lowered the rate of reaction, while modification of lysines in other regions had no effect. This indicates that the reaction of horse heart cytochrome c with the reaction center also involves the heme crevice domain.},

In pulse and chase experiments, we identified two precursors of the rRNA with mol.wts. of 1.04 x 10(6) and 0.70 x 10(6). From studies of the structure of the large rRNA, we propose that it could have arisen from a gene duplication.

The UV-visible spectrum of reconstituted FNR has a broad absorbance at 420 nm. The clusters are EPR silent under anaerobic conditions but are degraded to [3Fe-4S]+ by limited oxidation with air, and completely lost on prolonged air exposure. The association of FNR with the iron-sulphur clusters is confirmed by CD spectroscopy. Incorporation of the [4Fe-4S]2+ clusters increases site-specific DNA binding about 7-fold compared with apo-FNR. Anaerobic transcription activation and repression in vitro likewise depends on the presence of the iron-sulphur cluster, and its inactivation under aerobic conditions provides a demonstration in vitro of the FNR-mediated aerobic-anaerobic transcriptional switch.},

The gas phase was sampled and analyzed for NO with use of a chemiluminescence detector calibrated against bottled NO standards or against NO produced by the nitrite-iodide reaction. [NOaq] was inferred from [NOg] and the solubility of NO. NO was detected only during denitrification in amounts that, once established, did not change with time, were independent of the initial concentration of nitrate or nitrite, and were largely independent of cell concentration, at least when nitrate was the oxidant. The usual level of NO was promptly re-established following the addition of exogenous NO or following the loss of NO by sparging. The aforementioned properties are expected for a steady-state intermediate in denitrification. Steady-state [NOaq] ranged between 1 and 65 nM depending on species and conditions. Similar results were also obtained in a related experiment in which P. stutzeri strain ZoBell respired nitrite under growth conditions. The very low steady-state [NOaq] observed during denitrification imply that the maximum activity of nitric oxide reductase in vivo, if it could be realized, would be large relative to that for nitrite reductase. This circumstance allows NO to be an intermediate without reaching toxic steady-state levels.},

	abstract = {A spectrophotometric method has been developed that uses extracellular hemoglobin (Hb) to trap nitric oxide (NO) released during denitrification as nitrosyl hemoglobin (HbNO). The rate of complexation of NO with Hb is about at the diffusion controlled limit for protein molecules and the product, HbNO, is essentially stable. Hb was added to an anaerobic bacterial suspension and denitrification was initiated with either KNO2 or KNO3. HbNO formation was observed for six species of denitrifying bacteria and showed isosbestic points at 544, 568, and 586 nm. Cellular NO production, presumably by nitrite reductase, was kinetically distinct from the much slower chemical reaction of Hb with KNO2 to form methemoglobin and HbNO. The rate of HbNO formation was proportional to cell density, essentially independent of pH from 6.8 to 7.4, nearly zero order in [Hb] and, at least with Paracoccus denitrificans, strongly inhibited by rotenone and antimycin A. The Cu chelator, diethyldithiocarbamate, had no effect on HbNO formation by Pa. denitrificans, but abolished that by Achromobacter cycloclastes which uses a Cu-containing nitrite reductase known to be inactivated by the chelator. HbNO formation did not occur with non-denitrifying bacteria. The stoichiometry at high [Hb] for conversion of Hb to HbNO was 1.3-1.8 KNO2 per Hb for Pa. denitrificans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and A. cycloclastes and about 3.4 for Pseudomonas stutzeri. The former range of values corresponds to a partition of about 2 N atoms in 3 toward trapping and 1 in 3 toward reduction on the pathway to N2. Nitrogen not trapped appeared largely as N2O in presence of acetylene. The results are consistent with a model in which NO is a freely diffusible intermediate between nitrite and N2O, providing that nitric oxide reductase is or nearly is a diffusion controlled enzyme.},

Transfer of nirK to Escherichia coli resulted in an active nitrite reductase in vitro. Expression of the nirS gene from P. stutzeri in P. aureofaciens and E. coli led to nonfunctional gene products.

	abstract = {A new and relatively simple procedure to purify NO reductase from Paracoccus denitrificans by using the detergent lauryl maltoside has been developed. The purified enzyme consists of two subunits according to SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Analysis of the content of prosthetic groups indicates the presence of non-haem iron in addition to the presence b and c cytochromes yielding a stoichiometry of haem b/haem c/non-haem iron = 2:1:1. The optical spectrum of reduced NO reductase shows bands of low-spin haem c and haem b with alpha-band absorbance maxima at 551 nm and 558 nm, respectively. The optical spectrum of oxidized NO reductase shows a broad absorbance hand around 590 nm which disappears upon reduction. This latter absorbance is ascribed to a high-spin haem b (charge-transfer) transition. The presence of high-spin haem b is also indicated by the shifts observed in the optical spectrum of oxidized NO reductase in the presence of NO or in the spectrum of reduced enzyme after addition of CO. The main features of the EPR spectrum of the oxidized enzyme are resonances from a highly anisotropic low-spin haem b (gz = 3.53) and from an anisotropic low-spin haem c with gz, y, x = 2.99, 2.28, 1.46, the two haems being present in an approximate 1:1 stoichiometry. Minor signals representing about 1\% of the enzyme concentration due to high-spin haem b (g = 5.8-6.2) and a novel type of signal with g = 2.009 ascribed to high-spin non-haem ferric iron were also observed. The analysis of steady-state kinetic measurements of the NO reductase activity shows a sigmoidal relation between rate of NO reduction and NO concentration, consistent with a model describing sequential binding of two molecules of NO to the reduced enzyme. At high NO concentrations substrate inhibition occurs (Ki(apparent) = 13.5 microM) suggested to be due to binding of NO to oxidized enzyme. The absence from the EPR spectrum of signals originating from ferric non-haem iron and ferric high-spin haem b in stoichiometric amounts with respect to the enzyme concentration is suggested to be due to an antiferromagnetic coupling between these two centers. The steady-state kinetic behaviour and the optical and EPR spectroscopic properties of the NO reductase are incorporated into a tentative structural and mechanistic model.},

	abstract = {The cytochrome c peroxidase of Paracoccus denitrificans is similar to the well-studied enzyme from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Like the Pseudomonas enzyme, the Paracoccus peroxidase contains two haem c groups, one high potential and one low potential. The high-potential haem acts as a source of the second electron for H2O2 reduction, and the low-potential haem acts as a peroxidatic centre. Reduction with ascorbate of the high-potential haem of the Paracoccus enzyme results in a switch of the low-potential haem to a high-spin state, as shown by visible and n.m.r. spectroscopy. This high-spin haem of the mixed-valence enzyme is accessible to ligands and binds CN- with a KD of 5 microM. The Paracoccus enzyme is significantly different from that from Pseudomonas in the time course of high-spin formation after reduction of the high-potential haem, and in the requirement for bivalent cations. Reduction with 1 mM ascorbate at pH 6 is complete within 2 min, and this is followed by a slow appearance of the high-spin state with a half-time of 10 min. Thus the process of reduction and spin state change can be easily separated in time and the intermediate form obtained. This separation is also evident in e.p.r. spectra, although the slow change involves an alteration in the low-spin ligation at this temperature rather than a change in spin state. The separation is even more striking at pH 7.5, where no high-spin form is obtained until 1 mM Ca2+ is added to the mixed-valence enzyme. The spin-state switch of the low-potential haem shifts the midpoint redox potential of the high-potential haem by 50 mV, a further indication of haem-haem interaction.},

	abstract = {In work that is complementary to our investigation of the spectroscopic features of the cytochrome c peroxidase from Paracoccus denitrificans [Gilmour, Goodhew, Pettigrew, Prazeres, Moura and Moura (1993) Biochem. J. 294, 745-752], we have studied the kinetics of oxidation of cytochrome c by this enzyme. The enzyme, as isolated, is in the fully oxidized form and is relatively inactive. Reduction of the high-potential haem at pH 6 with ascorbate results in partial activation of the enzyme. Full activation is achieved by addition of 1 mM CaCl2. Enzyme activation is associated with formation of a high-spin state at the oxidized low-potential haem. EGTA treatment of the oxidized enzyme prevents activation after reduction with ascorbate, while treatment with EGTA of the reduced, partially activated, form abolishes the activity. We conclude that the active enzyme is a mixed-valence form with the low-potential haem in a high-spin state that is stabilized by Ca2+. Dilution of the enzyme results in a progressive loss of activity, the extent of which depends on the degree of dilution. Most of the activity lost upon dilution can be recovered after reconcentration. The M(r) of the enzyme on molecular-exclusion chromatography is concentration-dependent, with a shift to lower values at lower concentrations. Values of M(r) obtained are intermediate between those of a monomer (39,565) and a dimer. We propose that the active form of the enzyme is a dimer which dissociates at high dilution to give inactive monomers. From the activity of the enzyme at different dilutions, a KD of 0.8 microM can be calculated for the monomerdimer equilibrium. The cytochrome c peroxidase oxidizes horse ferrocytochrome c with first-order kinetics, even at high ferrocytochrome c concentrations. The maximal catalytic-centre activity ('turnover number') under the assay conditions used is 62,000 min-1, with a half-saturating ferrocytochrome c concentration of 3.3 microM. The corresponding values for the Paracoccus cytochrome c-550 (presumed to be the physiological substrate) are 85,000 min-1 and 13 microM. However, in this case, the kinetics deviate from first-order progress curves at all ferrocytochrome c concentrations. Consideration of the periplasmic environment in Paracoccus denitrificans leads us to propose that the enzyme will be present as the fully active dimer supplied with saturating ferrocytochrome c-550.},

CONCLUSIONS: The alpha-subunit of MDH has an eight-fold radial symmetry, with its eight beta-sheets stabilized by a novel tryptophan docking motif. The PQQ in the active site is held in place by a coplanar tryptophan and by a novel disulphide ring formed between adjacent cysteines which are bonded by an unusual non-planar trans peptide bond. One of the carbonyl oxygens of PQQ is bonded to the Ca2+, probably facilitating attack on the substrate, and the other carbonyl oxygen is out of the plane of the ring, confirming the presence of the predicted free-radical semiquinone form of the prosthetic group.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sialidases, or neuraminidases, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of many diseases, but are also produced by many non-pathogenic bacteria. Bacterial sialidases are very variable in size, often possessing domains in addition to the catalytic domain. The sialidase from the non-pathogenic soil bacterium Micromonospora viridifaciens is secreted in two forms with molecular weights of 41 kDa or 68 kDa, depending on the nature of the carbohydrate used to induce expression.
RESULTS: We report here the X-ray crystal structures of the 41 kDa and 68 kDa forms of the sialidase from M. viridifaciens at 1.8 A and 2.5 A resolution respectively. In addition, we report a complex of the 41 kDa form with an inhibitor at 2.0 A resolution, and a complex of the 68 kDa form with galactose at 2.5 A. The 41 kDa form shows the canonical sialidase beta-propeller fold. The 68 kDa form possesses two additional domains, one with an immunoglobulin-like fold that serves as a linker to the second, which is homologous to the galactose-binding domain of a fungal galactose oxidase.
CONCLUSIONS: The presence of the additional carbohydrate-binding domain in the 68 kDa form of the bacterial sialidase reported here is a further example of a combination of carbohydrate binding and cleaving domains which we observed in the sialidase from Vibrio cholerae. This dual function may be common, but only to other bacterial and parasitic sialidases, but also to other secreted glycosidases involved in pathogenesis. The bacterium may have acquired both the immunoglobulin module and the galactose-binding module from eukaryotes, as the enzyme shows a remarkable similarity to a fungal galactose oxidase which possesses similar domains performing different functions and assembled in a different order.},

The amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA shows significant similarity to those of sulfite oxidase from chicken liver and nitrate reductases from algal, fungal, and plant sources. Two cysteine residues are conserved in all of these proteins, and it is proposed that one or both of these cysteines serve as ligands to molybdenum. The gene has been expressed in Escherichia coli to a level equivalent to that observed in rat liver. The recombinant enzyme has been found to contain the molybdopterin form of the molybdenum cofactor and is active as determined by the sulfite dependent reduction of cytochrome c.},

	abstract = {The family of WD-repeat proteins comprises over 30 different proteins that share a highly conserved repeating motif [Neer, E. J., Schmidt, C. J., Nambudripad, R., \& Smith, T. F. (1994) Nature 371, 297-300]. Members of this family include the signal-transducing G protein beta subunit, as well as other proteins that regulate signal transduction, transcription, pre-mRNA splicing, cytoskeletal organization, and vesicular fusion. The crystal structure of one WD-repeat protein (G beta) has now been solved (Wall et al., 1995; Sondek et al, 1996) and reveals that the seven repeating units form a circular, propeller-like structure with seven blades each made up of four beta strands. It is very likely that all WD-repeat proteins form a similar structure. If so, it will be possible to use information about important surface regions of one family member to predict properties of another. If WD proteins form structures similar to G beta, their hydrodynamic properties should be those of compact, globular proteins, and they should be resistant to cleavage by trypsin. However, the only studied example of a WD-repeat protein, G beta, synthesized in vitro in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate, is unable to fold into a native structure without its partner protein G gamma. The non-WD-repeat amino terminal alpha helix of G beta does not inhibit folding because G beta does not fold even when this region is removed. It is not known whether all WD-repeat proteins are unable to fold when synthesized in an in vitro system. We synthesized seven members of the family in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate, determined their Stokes radius, sedimentation coefficient, and frictional ratio, and assayed their stability to trypsin. Our working definition of folding was that the proteins from globular, trypsin-resistant structures because, except for G beta gamma, their functions are not known or cannot be assayed in reticulocyte lysates. We chose proteins that include amino and carboxyl extensions as well as proteins that are made up entirely of WD-repeats. We show that unlike G beta, several proteins with WD-repeats are able to fold into globular proteins in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate. One protein, beta Trcp, formed large aggregates like G beta, suggesting that it may also require a partner protein. Despite the presence of many potential tryptic cleavage sites, all of the proteins that did fold gave stable large products on tryptic proteolysis, as predicted on the basis of the structure of G beta. These studies suggest that other WD-repeat proteins are likely to form propeller structures similar to G beta.},

The transcript for the four RP4-specified products is polycistronic. The vector system used in E. coli is based on the plasmid pKK223-3 (Brosius and Holy, 1984), a ColE1-type replicon which contains a polylinker sequence flanked on one side by the controllable tac promoter and on the other side by two strong transcriptional terminators. The gene for the lac repressor (lacIQ) was inserted to render the use of the plasmid independent from repressor-overproducing strains. The gene cartridge essential for high-level expression and selection was combined with the RSF1010 replicon to generate a vector plasmid functioning in a wide variety of Gram-negative hosts. The versatility of the vector family was extended by constructing derivatives that contain the polylinker in inverted orientation relative to the tac promoter. Therefore, the orientation of the cloned fragment can be chosen by 'forced cloning' into the appropriately selected vector.},

Dolla, R. Fu, M. J. Brumlik, and G. Voordouw, J. Bacteriol. 174:1726-1733, 1992). The homology is restricted to the cytoplasmic C-terminal signaling domain. The periplasmic N-terminal sensor domain was found to contain a unique sequence, CHHCH, corresponding to a consensus c-type heme binding site. A pretreated, DcrA-specific polyclonal antiserum, generated against DcrA protein overproduced in Escherichia coli, was used for immunoprecipitation of 35S-labeled DcrA from D. vulgaris and Desulfovibrio desulfuricans G200(pJRFR2), a transconjugant that overexpresses functional DcrA. Labeling of the latter with the heme precursor 5-amino-[4-14C]levulinic acid, followed by immunoprecipitation, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and fluorography, confirmed the presence of c-type heme, while labeling with L-[methyl-3H]methionine in the absence of protein synthesis confirmed that DcrA is a methyl-accepting protein. The base liability of the incorporated radioactivity indicated methyl ester formation like that occurring in the methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins of enteric bacteria. L-[methyl-3H]methionine labeling of D. desulfuricans G200(pJRFR2) under different conditions indicated that methyl labeling of DcrA decreased upon addition of oxygen and increased upon subsequent addition of the reducing agent dithionite.

Three regions were found where deletion mutations affect the mobilization of RSF1010 and increase its copy number in Escherichia coli. A deletion in the mobC gene increased the copy number of RSF1010 four-fold. Another deletion, that removed oriT and part of the promoter believed to be responsible for the expression of mobC, results in a three-fold increase in copy number. The third type of deletions affect the N-terminal part of RepB (MobA). A deletion that created a frame-shift results in a three-fold increase in copy number. A smaller, in-frame deletion of this region only affected the mobilization of RSF1010, but not its copy number. The extent by which RSF1010 or its deletion derivatives could repress the P1/P3 and P2 promoters has indicated that these promoters are negatively regulated by MobC and RepB (MobA), presumably by their attachment to the oriT region of RSF1010. Both MobC and RepB are required for the maximal repression of the rep operon. Optimal function of RSF1010 thus involves not only overlapping genes, but also proteins that exert multiple functions, mobilization, replication and regulation.},

It involves resampling points from one's own data, with replacement, to create a series of bootstrap samples of the same size as the original data. Each of these is analyzed, and the variation among the resulting estimates taken to indicate the size of the error involved in making estimates from the original data. In the case of phylogenies, it is argued that the proper method of resampling is to keep all of the original species while sampling characters with replacement, under the assumption that the characters have been independently drawn by the systematist and have evolved independently. Majority-rule consensus trees can be used to construct a phylogeny showing all of the inferred monophyletic groups that occurred in a majority of the bootstrap samples. If a group shows up 95\% of the time or more, the evidence for it is taken to be statistically significant. Existing computer programs can be used to analyze different bootstrap samples by using weights on the characters, the weight of a character being how many times it was drawn in bootstrap sampling. When all characters are perfectly compatible, as envisioned by Hennig, bootstrap sampling becomes unnecessary; the bootstrap method would show significant evidence for a group if it is defined by three or more characters.},

	abstract = {Nitrous oxide reductase (N2OR), Pseudomonas stutzeri, catalyses the 2 electron reduction of nitrous oxide to di-nitrogen. The enzyme has 2 identical subunits (Mr approximately 70,000) of known amino acid sequence and contains approximately 4 Cu ions per subunit. By measurement of the optical absorption, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and low-temperature magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectra of the oxidised state, a semi-reduced form and the fully reduced state of the enzyme it is shown that the enzyme contains 2 distinct copper centres of which one is assigned to an electron-transfer function, centre A, and the other to a catalytic site, centre Z. The latter is a binuclear copper centre with at least 1 cysteine ligand and cycles between oxidation levels Cu(II)/Cu(II) and Cu(II)/Cu(I) in the absence of substrate or inhibitors. The state Cu(II)/Cu(I) is enzymatically inactive. The MCD spectra provide evidence for a second form of centre Z, which may be enzymatically active, in the oxidised state of the enzyme. Centre A is structurally similar to that of CuA in bovine and bacterial cytochrome c oxidase and also contains copper ligated by cysteine. This centre may also be a binuclear copper complex.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Haemopexin is a serum glycoprotein that binds haem reversibly and delivers it to the liver where it is taken up by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Haemopexin has two homologous domains, each having a characteristic fourfold internal sequence repeat. Haemopexin-type domains are also found in other proteins, including the serum adhesion protein vitronectin and various collagenases, in which they mediate protein-protein interactions.
RESULTS: We have determined the crystal structure of the C-terminal domain of haemopexin at 1.8 A resolution. The domain is folded into four beta-leaflet modules, arranged in succession around a central pseudo-fourfold axis. A funnel-shaped tunnel through the centre of this disc-shaped domain serves as an ion-binding site.
CONCLUSIONS: A model for haem binding by haemopexin is proposed, utilizing an anion-binding site at the wider end of the central tunnel, together with an associated cleft. This parallels the active-site location in other beta-propeller structures. The capacity to bind both cations and anions, together with the disc shape of the domain, suggests that such domains may be used widely for macromolecular recognition.},

Improved quality of nonradioactive detection was obtained by the use of digoxigenin-labeled nucleotides in combination with dioxetane substrates which are decomposed by the hydrolysis of alkaline phosphatase. Previously existing problems involving unacceptably high background signals in nonradioactive labeling procedures were eliminated by the application of a modified RNA/DNA transfer, hybridization, and detection protocol. The data presented here delineate a system consistently superior to radioactivity and should considerably increase the usefulness of nonradioactively labeled probes detected by chemiluminescence.},

FNR is structurally and functionally homologous to CAP, the catabolite gene activator protein, and increased FNR production strongly stimulates transcription of its target genes. By analysis of RNA produced in vivo the promoters of four FNR-dependent genes were localized and shown to display a common arrangement. A 22bp dyad symmetry was found about 30 nucleotides upstream of the transcriptional startpoints and a similar sequence was shown to overlap the site of transcription initiation in the negatively controlled fnr gene. The consensus sequence for the half site recognized by FNR (AAA-TTGAT) is only slightly different from that of CAP (AA-TGTGA). Studies with two mutant frd promoters from Escherichia coli, displaying altered regulation and FNR response, provided additional evidence for recognition of this sequence by FNR.},

Component II showed an absorption maxima at 635 and 410 nm in the oxidized form and at 628, 552.5, 548 and 417 nm in the reduced form. The relative molecular mass, Mr, of both cytochromes was determined to be 135,000 with two identical subunits. Components I and II showed pI values of 7.6 and 6.8, respectively. The redox potential of hemes ranged from +234 mV to +242 mV, except for the heme d1 of component I (Em7 = +134 mV). Components I and II showed both cytochrome c oxidase and nitrite reductase activities. Cytochrome c oxidase activity was strongly inhibited by a low concentration of nitrite and cyanide. Erythrobacter cytochromes c-551 and c-552 were utilized as electron donors for the cytochrome c oxidase reaction. The high affinity of cytochrome c-552 to component II (Km = 1.27 microM) suggested a physiological significance for this cytochrome. Erythrobacter cytochromes cd1 are unique in their presence in cells grown under aerobic conditions as compared to other bacterial cytochromes cd1 which are formed only under denitrifying conditions.},

The product of nitrite reduction, nitric oxide (NO), acted as a product inhibitor in anaerobic assays with an apparent Ki of 0.2 microM, but only if the enzyme was first preincubated with NO for 15 min. The enzyme was inhibited by the oxidized form of electron donors and this could account for the decrease in rate during an assay. For the donors hydroquinone, ascorbate, TMPD, and azurin, measured values of the inhibition constant were at least ten fold lower than measured Km's. Cytochromes c as donors demonstrated a complex pattern of product inhibition by the ferric form.

	abstract = {The cytochrome bc1 complex is the most widely occurring electron transfer complex capable of energy transduction. Cytochrome bc1 complexes are found in the plasma membranes of phylogenetically diverse photosynthetic and respiring bacteria, and in the inner mitochondrial membrane of all eucaryotic cells. In all of these species the bc1 complex transfers electrons from a low-potential quinol to a higher-potential c-type cytochrome and links this electron transfer to proton translocation. Most bacteria also possess alternative pathways of quinol oxidation capable of circumventing the bc1 complex, but these pathways generally lack the energy-transducing, protontranslocating activity of the bc1 complex. All cytochrome bc1 complexes contain three electron transfer proteins which contain four redox prosthetic groups. These are cytochrome b, which contains two b heme groups that differ in their optical and thermodynamic properties; cytochrome c1, which contains a covalently bound c-type heme; and a 2Fe-2S iron-sulfur protein. The mechanism which links proton translocation to electron transfer through these proteins is the proton motive Q cycle, and this mechanism appears to be universal to all bc1 complexes. Experimentation is currently focused on understanding selected structure-function relationships prerequisite for these redox proteins to participate in the Q-cycle mechanism. The cytochrome bc1 complexes of mitochondria differ from those of bacteria, in that the former contain six to eight supernumerary polypeptides, in addition to the three redox proteins common to bacteria and mitochondria. These extra polypeptides are encoded in the nucleus and do not contain redox prosthetic groups. The functions of the supernumerary polypeptides of the mitochondrial bc1 complexes are generally not known and are being actively explored by genetically manipulating these proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.},

The branch lengths as well as the topology of a parsimonious tree can quickly be obtained by using this method. Using computer simulation, we studied the efficiency of this method in obtaining the correct unrooted tree in comparison with that of five other tree-making methods: the unweighted pair group method of analysis, Farris's method, Sattath and Tversky's method, Li's method, and Tateno et al.'s modified Farris method.

	abstract = {While many organisms synthesize delta-aminolevulinate, the precursor of heme, by condensing succinyl-coenzyme A and glycine, others use a glutamate-dependent pathway in which glutamyl-tRNA dehydrogenase catalyzes the rate-determining step. The hemeA gene that encodes this latter enzyme in Escherichia coli has been cloned and sequenced. To examine how its expression is regulated, we constructed hemA-lacZ operon and gene fusions and inserted them into the chromosome in single copy. The effect of aerobic and anaerobic growth conditions and the availability of electron acceptors and various carbon substrates were documented. Use of different types of cell culture medium resulted in a fivefold variation in hemA-lacZ expression during aerobic cell growth. Anaerobic growth resulted in 2.5-fold-higher hemA-lacZ expression than aerobic growth. This control is mediated by the fnr and arcA gene products. Fnr functions as a repressor of hemA transcription during anaerobic cell growth only, whereas the arcA gene product activates hemA gene expression under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Integration host factor protein was also shown to be required for control of hemA gene regulation. To determine whether an intermediate or a product of the heme biosynthetic pathway is involved in hemA regulation, hemA-lacZ expression was analyzed in a hemA mutant. Expression was elevated by 20-fold compared with that in a wild-type strain, while the addition of the heme pathway intermediate delta-aminolevulinate to the culture medium restored expression to wild-type levels. These results suggest that the heme pathway is feedback regulated at the level of hemA gene expression, to supply heme as it is required during different modes of cell growth.},

In this regard, their chemical and physical form, the manner in which they are applied, and the intensity of fertilization are dominant factors which should be considered when evaluating nitrogen-fertilizer effects on nitrogen-transformation processes.

# Construction of an unmarked deletion in the _nirS_ gene of _T. pantotropha_: complementation of the mutant and expression of a site-directed mutant of cytochrome _cd_$_1$ nitrite reductase {#chapter06}

## Introduction
In the previous two chapters, expression of the cloned _nirS_ gene from _T. pantotropha_ was investigated in the heterologous hosts
_E. coli_ and _Ps. aeruginosa_. In each of these cases holo cytochrome _cd_$_1$ could be obtained, either by reconstitution _in vitro_ with haem _d_$_1$ in the
former case or by expression under denitrifying conditions in the latter. It was seen that
neither of these approaches were ideal in terms of both the uniformity of the material
obtained and the difficulties in comparing the expressed material to the wild-type protein.
The experiments in this chapter therefore focus on a third possible expression system,
utilising a mutant of _T. pantotropha_ in which part of the _nirS_ gene has been deleted. Such
mutants would not synthesise cytochrome _cd_$_1$ nitrite reductase and would not be expected to
grow well under anaerobic conditions, using nitrate as a terminal electron acceptor, because
the nitrite that would accumulate in the absence of cytochrome _cd_$_1$ is toxic. In theory it
should be possible to complement the mutants using the _nirS_ gene on a plasmid and restore
growth on nitrate. However, there are three possible problems to consider using this
approach: first, over-expression of the plasmid-borne _nirS_ gene may interfere with the
normal regulation of denitrification in the cell (for instance by out-stripping the supply of
haem _d_$_1$ to the polypeptide), second, disruption of the _nirS_ gene may adversely affect _d_$_1$
haem biosynthesis and third, expression of inactive mutants of cytochrome _cd_$_1$ will not
restore growth on nitrate to the cells which will die because of the build-up of nitrite.

The experiments described in this chapter fall into three sections. In the first part the
construction of two mutagenic plasmids is described; these are used to insert a kanamycin
marker cassette upstream of the _nirS_ gene and then to construct the unmarked deletion in the
gene itself. The second part of the chapter concentrates on the analysis of this mutant and its
complementation using the cloned _nirS_ gene. Finally, in part three, attempts to express the
first site-directed mutant of cytochrome _cd_$_1$ in which Tyr-25 is replaced with phenylalanine
are described.

## Results
### Construction of mutagenic plasmids and of the unmarked deletion mutant in the _nirS_ gene
The methods used to construct an unmarked deletion in the _nirS_ gene of _T. pantotropha_ were
developed by van Spanning (1991) [@van_spanning_genes_1991]. To create the deletion two mutagenesis steps were used.
First, a kanamycin resistance marker was inserted upstream of the _nirS_ gene cloned in the
suicide plasmid pGRPd1. The plasmid was then mobilised into _T. pantotropha_ and cells in
which the marker had inserted into the chromosome by homologous recombination were
selected. This procedure is outlined in Figure 6.1.

```{r fig6-1, fig.cap="Construction of a kanamycin insertional mutant in the _nir_ region of the _T. pantotropha_ genome. (a) Plasmid pGRPN3K (Table 6.1) is introduced into the cell and undergoes a single homologous recombination with the _nir_ region of the chromosome. (b) This results in a plasmid integrant strain which is both kanamycin- and spectinomycin resistant due to the spectinomycin resistance gene on the vector. (c) A second homologous recombination results in integration of the _kan_ gene upstream of the _nirS_ gene and loss of the spectinomycin resistance determinant on the suicide plasmid. Enzymes: P, _PstI_, Sp, _SphI_.", fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, out.width='60%'}
include_graphics(path = "figure/fig6-1.png")
```

In the second step, a copy of the _nirS_ gene from which a fragment had been deleted was cloned into a second suicide plasmid,
pRVS1. This construct was then mobilised into the strain of _T. pantotropha_ carrying the
kanamycin marker and cells in which the marker and the wild-type _nirS_ gene were replaced
by the copy carrying the deletion were selected. This step is outlined in Figure 6.2.

The strategy for construction of the suicide plasmid containing the _nirS_ gene and the kanamycin marker is shown in Figure 6.3.

To create this plasmid, a 1.2 kbp _PstI_ fragment
containing the kanamycin resistance gene (_kan_) from the plasmid pUC4K [@vieira_puc_1982] was isolated and ligated into the _PstI_ site of the plasmid pTNIR3. The latter
site was located 27 bp upstream of the _nirS_ NNR box. The new plasmid, designated
pTNIR3K, was digested with _SphI_ to generate an 8.3 kbp fragment containing the _kan_ gene
and having 5'- and 3’-ends in the _norB_ and _nirE_ genes respectively, as was described in
Chapter 4 (Figure 4.2). The _SphI_ fragment was ligated into the _SphI_ site of the suicide
plasmid pGRPd1, to give the final construct for use in insertional mutagenesis which was
designated pGRPN3K. The plasmid was analysed by restriction digestion to confirm that it
was the desired construct (Figure 6.4).

```{r fig6-4, fig.cap="Restriction digest analysis of plasmid pGRPN3K.

_T. pantotropha_ was transformed with _pGRPN3K_ by conjugal transfer of the plasmid
from _E. coli_ S17-1. The mated cells were harvested, serially diluted and plated on minimal
acetate medium containing 100 $\mu$g ml$^{-1}$ kanamycin and 1 mM PbNO$_3$ to select for _T. pantotropha_ that had taken up the plasmid. 50 transconjugant colonies were picked from
these plates and streaked onto fresh minimal acetate medium containing 100 $\mu$g ml$^{-1}$
kanamycin and onto identical plates that contained additionally 100 $\mu$g ml$^{-1}$ spectinomycin.
The selection step distinguished vector integrant strains arising from a single crossover
(phenotype Km$^r$Sp$^r$) from the desired insertion mutant strains which arose from a double
crossover (phenotype Km$^r$Sp$^s$). Fifteen of the latter type were identified, although each
streak was still contaminated to some degree with _E. coli_ S17-1. To remove the
contaminants one of the streaks was picked with a sterile loop, diluted in LB medium and
lated on LB medium containing 100 $\mu$g ml$^{-1}$ kanamycin and 1 mM PbNO$_3$. Four single
colonies were obtained from this plate and designated _T. pantotropha_ K7-K10. The colonies
were confirmed as having the required Km$^r$Sp$^s$ phenotype. To confirm correct insertion of
the kanamycin resistance marker into the chromosome, genomic DNA was isolated from _T. pantotropha K7_, digested with _HindIII_ and probed by Southern blotting using the 1.2 kbp
fragment of pUC4K labelled with digoxigenin. Fragments of the expected sizes (4.8 and 1.1
kbp) were observed on the blot (Figure 6.5), confirming that the kan gene had inserted only
once in the expected site.

A 4.2 kbp _NotI_ fragment containing the _nirS_ gene and approximately 1.9 kbp
and 0.5 kbp of upstream and downstream DNA respectively was isolated from the plasmid
pTNIR3 and ligated into the _NotI_ site of the plasmid pGEM5zf(+), giving a plasmid which
was designated pLN3N. pLN3N was digested using _BamHI_ and _EcoRI_ to remove an internal
fragment of 382 bp from the _nirS_ gene. The fragment corresponded to amino acids 9 to 136
in the mature cytochrome _cd_$_1$ polypeptide and included the haem ligands His-17 and Tyr-25.
The DNA fragment from which the 382 bp fragment had been removed was isolated, the
ends were blunted using T4 DNA polymerase and the plasmid was religated. The absence of
the 382 bp fragment was demonstrated with digests using the enzymes _PstI_, _NotI_ and _SalI_ (Figure 6.7). 

```{r fig6-7, fig.cap="Restriction digest analysis of plasmids pLN3N and pLN3N$\\Delta$nir.

The digested DNA was separated by electrophoresis on a 0.8% agarose gel. Lanes 1 and 3 contain DNA from pLN3N, lanes 2 and 4 contain DNA from pLN3N$\\Delta$nir. In lane 1, three fragments of approximate sizes 3, 2.4 and 1.8 kbp are seen. The two smaller fragments correspond to the _NotI_ insert from pLN3N. In lane 2 the 2.4 kbp fragment has moved to 2 kbp, due to the removal of the 382 bp _BamHI_ - _EcoRI_ fragment. Lane 3 shows two _SalI_ fragments from pLN3N. In lane 4 the internal _SalI_ site in the 382 bp _BamHI_ - _EcoRI_ fragment has been lost, giving a linearised plasmid of approximate size 6.9 kbp.

These digests showed clearly that the plasmid had lost 382 bp and that a _SalI_ site which lay between the _BamHI_ and _EcoRI_ sites was not present. The new plasmid with
the 382 bp deletion was named pLN3N$\Delta$nir.
The _NotI_ fragment of pLN3N$\Delta$nir, now 3.8 kbp long, was isolated, the ends were
blunted using Sequenase (T7 DNA polymerase) and the fragment was ligated into the _SmaI_
site of the suicide vector pRVS1 to give the final construct for mutagenesis, designated
pRVS$\Delta$nir. The presence of the insert was confirmed by digestion with _EcoRI_, _StyI_ and _SalI_
(Figure 6.8) and by a PCR reaction using pRVS$\Delta$nir as template DNA and the primers nirSF
and MIDR (Table 3.1, Chapter 3).

```{r fig6-8, fig.cap="Restriction digest analysis of plasmids pRVS1 and pRVS$\\Delta$nir.

The digested DNA was then separated by electrophoresis on a 0.8% agarose gel. Lanes 1, 3, 5 and 7 contain DNA from plasmid pRVS1, lanes 2, 4, 6 and 8 contain DNA from plasmid pRVS$\\Delta$nir. As described in the text, restriction analysis of these plasmids was difficult to interpret due to the lack of a restriction map for pRVS1. However, the digests in lanes 1-2 and 5-6 clearly show that pRVS$\\Delta$nir contains an insert of around 3.8 kbp, the expected size of the insert. The digests in lanes 3-4 and 7-8 show extra _NruI_ and _StyI_ sites in pRVS$\\Delta$nir which can be related to the known sequence of the _nirS_ gene and to restriction analysis of plasmids containing the _nir_ region (Chapter 4).

This primer pair gave a 903 bp PCR product from the complete _nirS_ gene, but as the 382 bp deletion lies between the primers the expected size of
the PCR fragment should have been shortened to 521 bp. The smaller product was clearly
seen using pRVS$\Delta$nir as the template DNA (Figure 6.9).

_T. pantotropha_ K7 was transformed with pRVS$\Delta$nir by conjugal transfer from _E. coli_
S17-1 and transconjugants were selected initially on LB medium containing 100 $\mu$g ml$^{-1}$
kanamycin, 100 $\mu$g ml$^{-1}$ spectinomycin and 40 $\mu$g ml$^{-1}$ X-Gal. These conditions selected for
vector integrant strains formed by a single crossover, the _lacZ_ gene on the integrated plasmid
causing the colonies to be coloured pale blue. To promote the required double crossover
event, in which the vector together with the kanamycin resistance gene were excised and the
deletion was inserted into the chromosomal _nirS_ gene, a single blue colony was inoculated
into 1.5 ml of LB medium that contained no antibiotics and grown aerobically overnight.
This culture was inoculated into fresh LB medium and grown again. The culture was then
serially diluted and plated on LB medium containing X-Gal at a concentration of 80 $\mu$g ml$^{-1}$.
Most of the colonies obtained were vector integrants which formed small dark-blue colonies
on these plates. However, 25 white colonies were obtained and these were streaked onto
either LB medium, LB medium plus 100 $\mu$g ml$^{-1}$ kanamycin or LB medium plus 100 $\mu$g ml$^{-1}$
spectinomycin. Of these, three exhibited the required white, Km$^s$Sp$^s$ phenotype; they were
stocked and designated _T. pantotropha_ $\Delta5$, $\Delta7$ and $\Delta8$.
To confirm that the deletion in the chromosomal _nirS_ gene was correct, genomic DNA
was prepared from wild-type T. pantotropha, _T. pantotropha_ K7 and the three deletion
mutants, digested using _StyI_ and probed by Southern blotting using a 141 bp fragment of the
_nirS_ gene that had been labelled with digoxigenin by PCR. The Southern blot (Figure 6.10)
showed all of the expected hybridising fragments, confirming that the deletion mutants were
the desired ones.

### Analysis of the _nirS_ insertion and deletion mutants
The kanamycin insertion mutant, unmarked deletion mutant and wild-type strains of _T. pantotropha_ were compared first by growing each strain anaerobically in minimal succinate
medium plus 20 mM KNO$_3$ (Figure 6.11).

```{r fig6-11, fig.cap="Comparison of the anaerobic growth of _T. pantotropha_ with that of _T. pantotropha_ K7 and _T. pantotropha_ $\\Delta7$.

include_graphics(path = "figure/fig6-11.png")
```

_T. pantotropha_ wild-type and strain K7 grew at similar rates and reached a similar final optical density of around 1.3 at 650 nm. However,
the three _nirS_ deletion mutants grew poorly; each one entered stationary phase earlier than
the wild-type or kanamycin insertion strains and reached a final A$_{650}$ of only around 0.52.
In the unmarked deletion mutants cytochrome _cd_$_1$ should be absent, leading to a build
up of toxic nitrite due to nitrate reductase activity. To confirm this, 1 ml samples were taken
from each of the three cultures, harvested and assayed colorimetrically for nitrite (Figure
6.12).

```

Culture medium that contained wild-type _T. pantotropha_ showed a steady rise in
nitrite concentration to a maximum of about 3 mM near the end of the exponential growth
phase, followed by a rapid decline to undetectable levels in under two hours. A similar
process was observed for _T. pantotropha_ K7, although the maximum concentration of nitrite
reached was higher at 13 mM. In the unmarked deletion mutant nitrite concentration
continued to rise as growth slowed and reached a maximum of almost 20 mM, indicating
that almost all the nitrate originally present was converted to nitrite. The cells stopped
growing at about the time that maximum nitrite concentration was reached.

After growth, each of the cultures was harvested and a total soluble extract was
prepared by sonication and ultracentrifugation. The colour of the cell pellets from each
culture differed; the wild-type cells were brown when harvested, whereas cells of _T. pantotropha_ K7 were pink and cells from the deletion mutants were off-white. 40 $\mu$g of
protein from each extract was separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose and
probed by Western blotting using mouse antibody to _P. denitrificans_ cytochrome _cd_$_1$ (Figure
6.13).

Lanes that contained extract from _T. pantotropha_ and _T. pantotropha_ K7 each
contained a band of the same mobility (63 kDa) that corresponded to mature cytochrome _cd_$_1$.
This band was absent in the extract from _T. pantotropha_ $\Delta7$ and a new band of lower
mobility (approximately 47 kDa) was detected in this extract.
The plasmid pMMBSEK (described in Chapter 4) was used to complement the _nirS_
deletion mutant with the wild-type _nirS_ gene. The plasmid contained the _nirS_ gene with its
upstream promoter region, as well as a kanamycin resistance gene in the _PstI_ site upstream
of the NNR binding site. This arrangement provided a selectable marker in _T. pantotropha_
and also meant that induction using IPTG was unnecessary. Plasmid pMMBSEK was
transferred to _T. pantotropha_ $\Delta7$ by conjugation from _E. coli_ S17-1 and the transconjugants
were selected on minimal succinate medium containing 100 $\mu$g ml$^{-1}$ kanamycin. The
presence of the plasmid in _T. pantotropha_ $\Delta7$ was confirmed by plasmid isolation and
restriction digests using _HindIII_ (not shown). The transformed cells were grown
anaerobically in minimal succinate medium plus nitrate as before and the growth was
compared with _T. pantotropha_, _T. pantotropha_ K7 and _T. pantotropha_ $\Delta7$ (Figure 6.14).

Cells of _T. pantotropha_ $\Delta7$ that contained pMMBSEK grew normally and reached a similar

type culture (Figure 6.15).

A soluble extract was prepared from _T. pantotropha_ [pMMBSEK] and probed for cytochrome _cd_$_1$ using Western blotting. The expression of
mature cytochrome _cd_$_1$ was restored to the cells by pMMBSEK and the 63 kDa band stained
slightly more strongly in this extract than in the wild-type lane (Figure 6.13). The 47 kDa
hand observed in the extract from the deletion mutant _T. pantotropha_ $\Delta7$ was also observed
in the sample from _T. pantotropha_ $\Delta7$ [pMMBSEK].

### Construction of a cytochrome _cd_$_1$ mutant in which Tyr-25 is replaced by phenylalanine and expression of the mutant in _T. pantotropha_ $\Delta7$
Once it had been demonstrated that the _nirS_ deletion mutant could be complemented
successfully using pMMBSEK, the next step was to try to express a site-directed mutant of
cytochrome _cd_$_1$ using the same system. The first such mutant to be tried was one in which
Tyr-25 was replaced with phenylalanine (Y25F). The role of this residue was discussed in
Chapter 3 and reasons for the choice of this mutant are discussed further in the next section.
The DNA fragment containing the Y25F mutant of cytochrome _cd_$_1$ was constructed by
Dr. Simon Baker using the Promega Altered Sites II system. The mutagenic plasmid is
outlined in Figure 6.16.

```{r fig6-16, fig.cap="Construction of the plasmid pVA191-Y25F containing the Y25F mutation in the _nirS_ gene of _T. pantotropha_. A 600 bp _EcoRI_ fragment from the plasmid pBNIR (Chapter 4, Table 4.1) containing approximately the first 500 bp of the _nirS_ gene was cloned into the vector pALTER-1. The Promega Altered Sites II site-directed mutagenesis system was then used to anneal a mutagenic oligonucleotide to the gene, substituting phenylalanine for Tyr-25 and introducing a silent _MluI_ restriction site for screening during later manipulations. The insert was then sequenced to check for secondary mutations. The relevant sequence of the gene is shown, with the Y25F and _MluI_ mutations underlined.

include_graphics(path = "figure/fig6-16.png")
```

A 600 bp _EcoRI_ fragment from the plasmid pBNIR (Chapter 4, Table 4.1), containing the first 500 bp of the _nirS_ gene was ligated into the plasmid
pALTER-1. Tyr-25 was mutated to phenylalanine using a mutant oligonucleotide that additionally contained a silent mutation to introduce a restriction site for _MluI_ into the
fragment. The latter mutation allowed for rapid screening of mutant clones during later
manipulations and the mutant plasmid was named pVA191-Y25F. The strategy for insertion
of the Y25F mutation into the full-length _nirS_ gene is summarised in Figure 6.17.

```{r fig6-17, fig.cap="Construction of the expression plasmid pMMBY25F containing the Y25F mutation in the _nirS_ gene of _T. pantotropha_.

```

First, a _BamHI_ - _EcoRI_ fragment was removed from pVA191-Y25F. This fragment carried the Y25F
mutation and was the same 382 bp of DNA that was removed from the _nirS_ gene to construct
unmarked deletion mutants described in Section 6.2.1. The 382 bp fragment was ligated
into the plasmid pLN3N after first removing the equivalent fragment from the cloned _nirS_
gene in pLN3N and the new plasmid, designated pLN3NY25F was screened for the presence
of the new _MluI_ site. The _nirS_ gene containing the Y25F mutation was then cut from
pLN3NY25F as a 2.4 kbp _PstI_ - _NotI_ fragment and ligated into the vector pBluescript II
KS(+) which had been cut using the same enzymes. This construct was named pBY25F and
was analysed by restriction digestion and by partial sequencing using the 610F primer
(Chapter 3, Table 3.1) to confirm the cloning (Figure 6.18).

```{r fig6-18, fig.cap="Restriction digest analysis of plasmid pBY25FK.

Plasmid pBY25F from which pBY25FK was derived had previously been screened for the presence of the mutagenic _MluI_ site.

Enzymes: B, _BamHI_, E, _EcoRI_, H, _HindIII_, K, _KpnI_, N, _NruI_, S, _SalI_, Sa, _SacI_, St, _StyI_.

```

To construct an expression plasmid containing the _nirS_ Y25F mutant gene, the 1.2 kbp _PstI_ fragment from pUC4K
containing the kanamycin resistance gene was ligated into the _PstI_ site of pBY25F and a 3.7
bp _KpnI_ - _SacI_ fragment containing this marker together with the mutated _nirS_ gene was
ligated into the broad host range vector pMMB67EH that had been cut with the same
enzymes. The final plasmid, pMMBY25F, was thus identical to pMMBSEK except for the
Y25F mutation in the _nirS_ gene and was checked by digestion using _MluI_ (Figure 6.19).

```{r fig6-19, fig.cap="Restriction digest analysis of plasmid pMMBY25F using _MluI_.

pMMBY25F was transferred to _T. pantotropha_ $\Delta7$ by conjugal transfer from _E. coli_
S17-1 and the transconjugants were selected on minimal succinate medium containing 100
$\mu$g ml$^{-1}$ kanamycin. _T. pantotropha_ $\Delta7$ [pMMBY25F] was then grown anaerobically in
minimal succinate medium plus nitrate containing 100 $\mu$g ml$^{-1}$ kanamycin (Figure 6.20a).

Growth of _T. pantotropha_ $\Delta7$ [pMMBY25F] was virtually indistinguishable from that of the
deletion mutants. Additionally, nitrite accumulated in the culture medium of _T. pantotropha_
[pMMBY25F] to almost 20 mM just as was seen in the deletion mutant cultures (Figure
6.20b). A total soluble extract was prepared from _T. pantotropha_ $\Delta7$ [pMMBY25F] and
probed for cytochrome _cd_$_1$ by Western blotting as described earlier (Figure 6.13). The 63
kDa band that corresponded to mature cytochrome _cd_$_1$ was much fainter in this extract than
in the extracts from wild-type, _T. pantotropha_ K7 or _T. pantotropha_ $\Delta7$ [pMMBSEK] and
the 47 kDa band seen in the extracts from the deletion mutant was also present.

Although the cytochrome _cd_$_1$ Y25F mutant appeared to be inactive (as cultures of _T. pantotropha_ $\Delta7$ [pMMBY25F] accumulated nitrite as though nitrite reductase were absent)
and present in low amounts, partial purification of the protein was attempted. 20 l of _T. pantotropha_ $\Delta7$ [pMMBY25F] was grown anaerobically overnight, harvested and
spheroplasted to give 94 ml of periplasmic extract. The extract was bound to a DEAE
Sepharose column and eluted using a linear gradient of NaCl. Elution of haem proteins was
followed by measuring the absorbance of the fractions at 410 nm (Figure 6.21).

A pink band that bound weakly to the column was eluted during washing in some trials, or in the early
part of the gradient in others; in Figure 6.21 this peak is not visible as it eluted during the
wash, but it is referred to as Peak 1. Three other major peaks (2-4) eluted from the column at
approximately 100, 150 and 220 mM NaCl respectively; these peak fractions were coloured
pink, yellow-brown and dark brown respectively. Additionally, a blue coloured peak eluted
from the column at approximately 50 mM NaCl; this peak was recorded by measuring its
absorbance at 595 nm as shown in Figure 6.21.
15 $\mu$l of the fraction from the top of Peaks 1-4 was separated by SDS-PAGE and
stained in order to identify _c_-type cytochromes (Figure 6.22).

The weakly-binding pink fractions under Peak 1 contained a _c_-type cytochrome with a molecular weight of

weights on SDS-PAGE of 17, 12 and 45 kDa respectively. Peaks 1 and 3 did not stain
strongly when Coomassie Blue was used to stain the gel (not shown). UV-visible spectroscopy was used to characterise further the coloured fractions. As isolated, peak 1
exhibited absorbance maxima at 406 and 528 nm (Figure 6.23a).

## Discussion
The method used to construct an unmarked deletion in the _nirS_ gene of _T. pantotropha_ has
been used previously in the closely-related organism _P. denitrificans_ PD1222 to mutate a
number of genes including those encoding amicyanin [@van_spanning_mutagenesis_1990],
cytochrome _c_$_{551i}$, cytochrome c$_{550}$ and cytochrome c$_{553i}$ [@van_spanning_method_1991], the
cytochrome _c_ oxidases _aa_$_3$ and _cbb_$_3$ [@van_der_oost_reversed_1995] and the genes _moxJ_ and
_moxG_ which are involved in methanol oxidation [@van_spanning_isolation_1991]. The method
has a number of advantages as compared to simple insertional mutagenesis using an
antibiotic resistance cassette; first, in-frame deletions can be constructed in order to prevent
polar effects on genes downstream of the mutated target gene and, second, the method allows
for the construction of multiple mutations by the repeated insertion of a kanamycin marker
into several targets followed by its replacement with the unmarked deletion. This is
especially important for _P. denitrificans_ in which few selectable markers have been reported
 [@steinrucke_genetics_1993].

The first step of the mutagenic procedure, insertion of the kanamycin cassette into the
_PstI_ site upstream of _nirS_, was accomplished quite easily. A large number of kanamycin
resistant transconjugants were selected after mating and 15 out of 100 of these proved to be
exconjugants when tested for spectinomycin susceptibility. This compares well with the
frequency of 40% reported for kanamycin insertion mutagenesis of the _cycA_ gene in _P. denitrificans_ [@van_spanning_genes_1991]. The ease of this procedure was probably due in part to the extensive homologous regions each side of the kanamycin cassette in the mutagenic
plasmid pGRPN3K, in which there was approximately 5.1 kbp and 2.1 kbp of DNA
upstream and downstream respectively of the kanamycin cassette. It has been suggested that
at least 1 kb of homologous DNA each side of the insertion region is desirable for efficient
homologous recombination of both arms in _P. denitrificans_ (Dr. Simon Baker, personal
communication). Southern blotting using the labelled kanamycin cassette showed clearly
that the fragment has inserted only once into the chromosome and the hybridisation of the
fragment to genomic DNA digested with _HindIII_ indicated that the insertion was at the
correct site. This was confirmed by hybridisation of the labelled _nirS_ gene fragment to DNA
digested using _StyI_, although in this experiment hybridisation to the larger of the two
expected fragments was very weak, probably due to the low region of overlap between the
large fragment and the small _nirS_-derived probe.

The second step of the method, replacement of the _nirS_ gene and the kanamycin
marker by an unmarked mutation was somewhat more difficult to achieve. This was largely
due to difficulties experienced in ligating the blunted _NotI_ fragment from pLN3N$\Delta$nir into
the blunt-ended _SmaI_ site of pRVS1. Eventually this cloning was achieved by blunting the
_NotI_ ends using T7 DNA polymerase. Restriction analysis of the plasmid pRVS$\Delta$nir was
complicated by the lack of a published restriction map for this plasmid and by the
observation that with certain enzymes (*e.g.* _PstI_) an anomalous restriction pattern was
observed in which the sizes of the fragments produced did not appear to add up to the total
size of the plasmid (11.6 kbp). However, the correctness of the construct was confirmed by a
combination of restriction and PCR analyses, and ultimately by Southern blotting of the
mutants obtained and their subsequent analysis. In future it would be advantageous to
engineer fragments for cloning into pRVS1 to have the appropriate restriction sites at their
termini and to have a detailed restriction map of the plasmid.

Replacement of the chromosomal _nirS_ gene with the unmarked deletion also proved to
be quite challenging. To begin with, the procedure for selection of cells in which pRVS$\Delta$nir
had become integrated into the chromosome proved to be slightly different to the published
protocol [@van_spanning_genes_1991], in that a concentration of 20 $\mu$g ml$^{-1}$ of X-Gal in the plates
was not sufficient to turn the colonies blue. At 40 $\mu$g ml$^{-1}$ the colonies were pale-blue.
However, the presence of spectinomycin and kanamycin, both at 100 $\mu$g ml$^{-1}$, should have
been sufficient to detect plasmid integrant strains. In the next stage of the published protocol
cells are scraped from these plates, replated in the absence of antibiotics to promote excision
of the plasmid from the chromosome, then collected once more and plated in the presence of
a high X-Gal concentration to detect exconjugants, which colour white under these
conditions. In the case of _T. pantotropha_ very few white colonies were obtained in this way,
and so a single colony was grown for two cycles in liquid culture to promote
recombinational excision of the plasmid. The number of white colonies obtained was
increased but was still very low; 25 were obtained after the second culture was diluted 10$^7$
fold and plated on 10 plates, of which three colonies were kanamycin-sensitive and
contained the deletion. The frequency is somewhat lower than that reported for deletion
mutagenesis of the _cycA_ gene in _P. denitrificans_ (resolution frequency of 5 x 10$^{-4}$, of which
25% were kanamycin-sensitive [@van_spanning_genes_1991].

Growth of the deletion mutant strains revealed the expected phenotype as compared
with the wild-type cells; in the absence of cytochrome _cd_$_1$ the nitrite produced by nitrate
reductase activity accumulates rapidly to levels beyond which the cells no longer grow. It is
notable that the maximum nitrite concentration reached was practically equal to that of the
nitrate supplied originally in the medium, indicating that even if the cells are not growing
nitrate reductase activity is able to continue quite efficiently. The peak nitrite concentration
reached in cultures containing the kanamycin insertion was somewhat higher than in the
wild-type strain, indicating that nitrite reduction in this strain was impaired. On a Western
blot, slightly less cytochrome _cd_$_1$ was observed in this mutant strain, and when harvested, the
cells were noticeably pink compared to the wild-type. The kanamycin insertion lies in the
promoter region of the _nirI_ gene, which is known to be involved in the regulation of _nirS_
expression [de_boer_regulation_1996]. It is probable that in this mutant expression of _nirI_ is impaired
but not abolished, allowing the formation of some active cytochrome _cd_$_1$. The pink colour of
the cell pellet is possibly due to the expression of some semi-apo cytochrome _cd_$_1$, which is
pink as it lacks the _d_$_1$ haem, and/or to the attenuated level of holo-cytochrome _cd_$_1$ which
normally colours the cell pellet brown.

Western blotting of the cell extracts from the deletion mutants showed that cytochrome
_cd_$_1$ was absent, but revealed the presence of a new band with an approximate molecular
weight of 47 kDa. This band was specific to the deletion mutant and cells derived from it (it
was also observed in _T. pantotropha_ $\Delta7$ carrying the plasmids pMMBSEK and pMMBY25F,
but not in the extracts from wild-type cells or from _T. pantotropha_ K7). The most likely
explanation for this band is that it represents a truncated form of cytochrome _cd_$_1$ generated
by the removal of the 382 bp _BamHI_ - _EcoRI_ fragment. During the latter procedure the
cohesive termini generated by restriction using these enzymes were filled in using T4 DNA
polymerase. Without sequencing across this junction it is not possible to know precisely
what junction was formed, as the polymerase may have removed some nucleotides from
either terminus as well as filling in the ends. However, analysis of the truncated gene using
the program SeqAid [@roufa_seqaid_1989] indicates that the procedure may have
generated two new open reading frames. The first of these begins at the original ATG start
codon and is 264 bp long, encoding for 88 amino acids and is unlikely to be relevant. The
second begins at an ATG codon after the deletion and encodes a polypeptide of 429 amino
acids long (47.8 kDa) and this protein may be the species that is cross-reacting on the
Western blot. The presence of this polypeptide is not significant in terms of the later
complementation and mutagenesis experiments as it is unlikely to be periplasmic in the
absence of a targeting sequence, is clearly not active and does not contain the region in
which the Y25F mutation was made and so could not exchange this residue with the mutated
residue on plasmid pMMBY25F.

Complementation of the deletion mutant _T. pantotropha_ $\Delta7$ using the plasmid
pMMBSEK was successful, as shown by the restoration of growth on nitrate and the
presence of the cytochrome _cd_$_1$ polypeptide by Western blotting. The latter technique
showed that there was a significant, but not excessive, increase in the amount of expressed
protein from the plasmid as compared with the chromosomal copy of the gene, indicating
that the copy number is quite low in _T. pantotropha_ as was discussed in Chapter 5. The
increased levels of cytochrome _cd_$_1$ do not seem to have had a deleterious effect on the
regulation of denitrification in the cells as judged by analysis of the growth curves and of
nitrite levels in the culture medium, both of which were very similar to wild-type cultures.
pMMBSEK proved to be a good choice of plasmid for these experiments; it contains the
kanamycin resistance gene which is selectable in _T. pantotropha_ and the upstream promoter
region which seems to be fully functional, removing the need for induction using IPTG. The
last point is important as the _tac_ promoter is believed to function quite poorly in _P. denitrificans_ 
(Dr. M.L.D. Page and Dr. E. Gordon, personal communication).

Having demonstrated that the _nirS_ deletion mutant could be complemented
successfully with a plasmid the next step was to try complementation using a site-directed
mutant of the _nirS_ gene. The first mutant chosen was one in which Tyr-25 was mutated to
phenylalanine. The role of Tyr-25 was discussed in Chapter 3; it is a ligand to the _d_$_1$ haem
in the oxidised enzyme structure and is postulated to displace nitric oxide from the haem iron
during the catalytic cycle of nitrite reduction [@fulop_anatomy_1995]. This crucial role made
Tyr-25 an attractive candidate for mutagenesis. Phenylalanine was chosen as a replacement
residue as it has the same core structure as tyrosine, lacking only the hydroxyl group; the
latter feature would be expected to prevent bonding to the _d_$_1$ haem iron. Additionally, Tyr-25 
is located on the 382 bp _BamHI_ - _EcoRI_ fragment that was removed from the chromosomal _nirS_ gene 
to make the deletion mutant. This facilitated the construction of the mutant as the
same fragment could be inserted into the expression plasmid as a cassette and screened for
using the silent _MluI_ restriction site. The absence of the residue in the chromosomal copy of
the gene also meant that it could not be transferred to the plasmid by homologous
recombination, although the probability of this kind of transfer is quite low and can always
be monitored by isolation of the plasmid from the cells and restriction analysis or
sequencing. One other possibility is that of reversion, in which the Y25F mutant of the _nirS_
gene might be transferred to the chromosome by homologous recombination and then
repaired by random mutation to give the wild-type gene. However, this is most unlikely as
the amount of homologous overlapping DNA between the plasmid and the chromosome is
quite low, especially at the 5'-end and, additionally, reversion is extremely rare in _P. denitrificans_ 
except under conditions of extreme selective pressure [@steinrucke_genetics_1993].

Growth of _T. pantotropha_ $\Delta7$ [pMMBY25F) anaerobically on nitrate showed a
phenotype that was virtually identical to that of the deletion mutants, with poor growth and
an accumulation of nitrite to toxic levels. This was taken initially as evidence that the
expressed protein was not active. However, Western blotting showed that only very low
amounts of the protein were present. This might have been a consequence of the low yield
of cells (an ideal control experiment at this stage, although not possible in the present work,
would have been to compare the level of cytochrome _cd_$_1$ to that in cells in which
denitrification was impaired due to another cause, such as mutations in other electron
transfer components), but the amount of cytochrome _cd_$_1$ seemed abnormally low even taking
the poor growth into account. To investigate this further 20 l of cells were grown and partial
purification of cytochrome _cd_$_1$ was attempted from a periplasmic extract. Despite several
trials no cytochrome _cd_$_1$ was isolated from a DEAE-Sepharose ion-exchange column in
these experiments. By contrast the amounts of cytochrome _c_$_{550}$ and cytochrome _c_' (proteins
that are normally observed during cytochrome _cd_$_1$ purification) seemed to be close to or even
slightly higher than what would have been expected when taking into account the reduced
growth of the cells as compared to wild-type cultures. These results indicate that the Y25F
mutation resulted in a greatly attenuated level of expressed cytochrome _cd_$_1$, perhaps as a
result of degradation of the protein. Unfortunately, this result does not allow a definite
conclusion as to whether Tyr-25 is essential for the enzymatic activity of cytochrome _cd_$_1$,
since it was not possible to isolate sufficient quantities of the mutant enzyme for kinetic
analyses. However, as the mutant was expressed _in vivo_ in _T. pantotropha_, it can be stated
that Tyr-25 is certainly a vital residue in some sense. One possible reason for the postulated
degradation could be that Tyr-25 plays an important structural role during assembly of the
enzyme. As well as ligating to the _d_$_1$ haem iron, Tyr-25 is hydrogen-bonded via a water
molecule to the residues His-345 and His-388 in the oxidised structure of cytochrome _cd_$_1$
 [@baker_cytochrome_1997] and so is structurally important. It may be that some or all of the above
interactions are important during the assembly and folding of cytochrome _cd_$_1$ _in vivo_ and
that their absence in the Y25F mutant accounts for its degradation. However, an equally
valid argument is that the absence of enzymatic activity in the Y25F mutant leads to the
degradation of the enzyme as the cells experience increasingly non-physiological conditions
because of the accumulation of nitrite. Notably, Tyr-25 is disordered in the reduced structure
of cytochrome _cd_$_1$, which is likely to be the physiologically-relevant form (Chapter 3) and so
at least some degree of complementation using pMMBY25F might have been expected, had
the Y25F mutant been active.

The growth of _T. pantotropha_ $\Delta7$ [pMMBY25F] is essentially identical to that of the
deletion mutant alone and some interesting observations can be made concerning the
cytochrome content of the cells. First, a small _c_-type cytochrome was observed
(approximately 16 kDa on SDS-PAGE) which bound only weakly to the DEAE-Sepharose
column, stained poorly with Coomassie Blue and auto-oxidised following reduction using
sodium dithionite. This cytochrome has not been observed previously during purification of
cytochrome _cd_$_1$ from wild-type cultures of _T. pantotropha_ and its function is unknown. The
spectrum of the cytochrome did not correspond to any known published spectrum of _c_-type
cytochromes from _P. denitrificans_ or other organisms, and so N-terminal sequencing would
be a useful first step in an attempt to identify this protein. It may be expressed as a
consequence of stress placed on the cells by the high nitrite concentration. Further evidence
that the mutant cells grown under these conditions are under some form of oxidative stress
was deduced from the elevated levels of cytochrome _c_ peroxidase found in the cells.
Normally this protein is seen only as a small absorbance at 410 nm eluting just before
cytochrome _cd_$_1$ from the DEAE-Sepharose column when wild-type cells are grown
anaerobically with nitrate. However, in the mutant culture cytochrome _c_ peroxidase was the
major _c_-type cytochrome. It was also notable that elevated levels of the small blue copper
protein pseudoazurin were present, giving a blue colour to the fractions in which the protein
eluted that was clearly visible to the eye. Although the yield of pseudoazurin from wild-type
T. pantotropha has been reported as 0.6 mg l$^{-1}$ [@moir_aspects_1993], the protein has been
consistently difficult to detect during routine purification of cytochrome _cd_$_1$ over the course
of the present work. The amounts observed in this case seem especially significant when the
poor cell yield is considered. This observation may indicate that pseudoazurin is produced in
response to oxidative stress and/or it may be an electron donor to cytochrome _c_ peroxidase in
an analogous role to the similar protein azurin [@ronnberg_reaction_1981].

The complementation of the _nirS_ deletion mutant using pMMBSEK has shown that
this is a viable expression system for cytochrome _cd_$_1$, provided that the recombinant protein
is stable. Although the growth of the cells is poor the final optical density is still equivalent
to that of wild-type cells in early exponential phase and the yield of other cytochromes from
the ion-exchange column indicates that enough cytochrome _cd_$_1$ could be obtained for further
studies, provided that it was not degraded. It may also be possible to increase the cell yield
by dialysis culture to remove the toxic nitrite produced or by simply growing larger culture
volumes. However, the potential instability of mutants such as Y25F presents a different
problem. As the mutant cytochrome _cd_$_1$ could not be isolated from scaled-up cultures, it was
not possible to find out whether Tyr-25 was an essential residue for catalysis. This question
might be answered using the reconstitution of the expressed semi-apo protein from _E. coli_
that was described in Chapter 4. In this case the assembly of the protein differs to that _in vivo_, in that 
it does not depend on the presence of Tyr-25 to ligand with the _d_$_1$ haem during synthesis and folding 
because the _d_$_1$ haem is not present. It may therefore be possible to
insert the haem by reconstitution into semi-apo cytochrome _cd_$_1$ Y25F and determine whether
the protein is catalytically active. The comments from Chapter 4 concerning improvements
to the expression system and standardisation of the reconstitution protocol are equally valid
here. Additionally, there are a large number of other potential targets for site-directed
mutagenesis that may still be tried using expression in _T pantotropha_ $\Delta7$ or in _E. coli_.
These include His-17 which is the proximal ligand to the _c_-haem in the oxidised structure,
Met-106, the proximal _c_-haem ligand in the reduced structure and His-345 or His-388, which
are believed to act as proton donors during the dehydration of nitrite at the active site. The
first two of these lie in the 382 bp deleted region of the _nirS_ gene and could be constructed in
much the same way as the Y25F mutant described in this chapter.

## Abstract {-}

The _nirS_ gene, which encodes the enzyme cytochrome _cd_<sub>1</sub> nitrite reductase in the denitrifying
bacterium _Thiosphaera pantotropha_, was cloned and sequenced. The sequence of this
cytochrome _cd_<sub>1</sub> was found to be very similar to those of the proteins not only from the
closely-related organism _P. denitrificans_ but also several other species of bacteria. However,
the N-terminal region of these proteins shows less similarity than the overall protein
sequence. Furthermore, sequence analysis in combination with spectroscopic and structural
data indicates that the ligands to the _c_- and _d_<sub>1</sub>-haem groups are not identical in cytochromes
_cd_<sub>1</sub> from different sources. Implications for the mechanism of the enzyme are discussed.

Three different approaches were taken to the problem of expressing recombinant
cytochrome _cd_<sub>1</sub> from the cloned _nirS_ gene. First, the gene was expressed in _Escherichia coli_,
yielding a semi-apo enzyme that contained only the _c_-type haem. The protein could be
reconstituted to some degree using purified haem _d_<sub>1</sub>, producing an enzyme with some of the
spectroscopic features of the native holoenzyme and around 50% of the native nitrite
reductase activity. This approach should be of use in the future expression of site-directed
mutants of cytochrome _cd_<sub>1</sub>, which would be structurally unstable or enzymically inactive if
expressed as the holoenzyme in a heterologous denitrifying host.

Second, the _T. pantotropha_ _nirS_ gene was expressed in the denitrifying bacterium _Ps. aeruginosa_ which synthesises an endogenous cytochrome _cd_<sub>1</sub>. Under the growth conditions employed, a mixture of holo- and semi-apo recombinant cytochrome _cd_<sub>1</sub> was produced. Differences in the visible spectrum of the holoenzyme and attenuated nitrite reductase and cytochrome _c_ oxidase activities suggested that it was not fully assembled in this system. However, the system may be of use in distinguishing site-directed mutants of the enzyme that are enzymically inactive from those that retain some activity.

Third, an unmarked deletion was constructed in the genomic copy of the _T. pantotropha_ _nirS_ gene which abolished the synthesis of cytochrome _cd_<sub>1</sub>. It then proved possible to restore denitrifying growth to the mutant by complementation with the cloned wild-type _nirS_ gene. However, complementation using a site-directed mutant of cytochrome _cd_<sub>1</sub>, in which the _d_<sub>1</sub> haem ligand Tyr-25 was replaced with phenylalanine failed to restore growth and the cells contained greatly attenuated levels of the mutant cytochrome _cd_<sub>1</sub>. Possible reasons for this result are discussed. These data illustrate the problem of finding an expression system that can synthesise the holoenzyme but does not rely upon its activity to maintain the growth of the host organism.

The transcription start site of the _nirS_ gene was determined using 5'-RACE and primer
extension. The _nirS_ gene was found to be transcribed as a monocistronic mRNA.
Comparison of the upstream region of the _nirS_ gene with other denitrification genes indicates
a common mechanism of transcriptional regulation and suggests that such genes may be
transcribed using a specific sigma factor.

My thanks first to Stuart, for taking me on in the first place, organising the funding and for his advice and encouragement during the project, particularly in the writing of this thesis. Thanks are also due to the Wellcome Trust, for their absurdly generous studentship, to Graham Pettigrew, who got me into bacterial _c_-type cytochromes in the first place, and to Thon de Boer, for his cytochrome _cd_<sub>1</sub> antibody and for the gift of pTNIR3, the plasmid that saved the project! Thanks too, to Val for a huge number of perfect primers and to Colin for excellent photography.

Lab 5-9 has been graced by a number of wonderful postdocs; my thanks especially to Simon, for his support throughout the project and for not laughing (too much) during my transformation (ho ho) to a molecular biologist. And a big thank-you to Dudley, for advice on almost everything and conversation during the late nights, long weekends and even the more normal times of day. Variety has certainly been the spice of life in 5-9 thanks to Dave, Ben, Yoshi, Fiona, Alrik, Neeti, Isobel, our latest arrivals and all our visiting students. Outside of 5-9, thanks especially to Pam, Vilmos and Janos, Andy, the 6th floor crowd and of course Gerry and Rachel for much-needed caffeine and sugar, with a smile.

On the brief occasions that I escaped to the world outside, the Oxford “1st wave”, John, Hannah, Jacqui, Caroline and Sara had a lot to answer for. Thanks too to the Oxford “2nd wave”, especially Mat and Lucy, Jem and Lisa, Ralph, Charlie, Craig, Mark and Amanda and of course Marian, for rescuing me and making me realise it wasn't all bad! Most of all, thanks to the folks in Edinburgh, for great holidays, time spent amongst mountains, accommodation, beers, entertainment and empathy: Mark, Leo, Jo, Anita and Lorna, and to my fellow "refugees in England” or further abroad; Mary Jane, James and Nim, Marc and Karen, and Colin and Michelle. I'd never have made it without all of you. I must also thank Mark E. Smith and The Fall, for twenty years of brilliant records.

Last, but definitely not least, a big thank-you to my parents, for all their support over the last eight years. I guess this is for you.

# Heterologous expression of the _nirS_ gene from _T. pantotropha_ in the denitrifying host _Ps. aeruginosa_ {#chapter05}

## Introduction
In the previous chapter it was demonstrated that the _nirS_ gene from _T. pantotropha_ can be
expressed in _E. coli_ to give a semi-apo protein containing only _c_-type haem, and that this
protein can be reconstituted with purified _d_$_1$ haem to restore some nitrite reductase activity.
There are a number of disadvantages to this approach, in particular the requirement for large
quantities of purified _d_$_1$ haem which can only be obtained from several tens of milligrams of
purified cytochrome _cd_$_1$. Additionally, the expression of the protein and the reconstitution
protocol require substantial optimisation; heterogeneity in the reconstituted material may
thus be a problem during crystallisation or attempts to compare thoroughly different samples.

An ideal expression system would, therefore, synthesise holo cytochrome _cd_$_1$ that
contained both the _c_- and _d_$_1$ haems, in a form that could be easily purified, assayed for
activity and crystallised for structural studies so as to compare site-directed mutants of the
enzyme with the native protein. One approach to this may be to express the cloned _nirS_ gene
in a heterologous host which also contains an endogenous cytochrome _cd_$_1$-type nitrite
reductase. This requires a denitrifying organism that is genetically amenable. It would be
hoped that the cloned gene would be expressed at a sufficiently high level and that the
recombinant protein would be translocated to the periplasm, where _c_-haem could be
covalently attached. Additionally, a sufficient pool of free _d_$_1$ haem would exist that could be
sequestrated and incorporated into the recombinant cytochrome _cd_$_1$. Finally the process
should not compromise the growth of the host organism and the recombinant protein should
be physically different to the endogenous nitrite reductase, so that it can be separated and
purified for further analysis.

The experiments described in this chapter were designed to investigate the expression
of the _nirS_ gene from _T. pantotropha_ in the host _Ps. aeruginosa_ PAO1. The latter organism
was selected using the criteria outlined above; it contains a cytochrome _cd_$_1$ nitrite reductase
(Horio et al., 1961 [@horio_purification_1961]) and systems for genetic manipulation have been developed in the
organism (Rothmel et al., 1991 [@rothmel_genetic_1991]). Additionally, the isoelectric point of the cytochrome _cd_$_1$
from this organism (approximately 7.0, Hull and Wharton, 1993 [@hull_isoelectrophoretic_1993]) is much more basic than
that of the enzyme from _T. pantotropha_ (predicted from the protein sequence to be 4.75), and
so the expressed protein should be separable from the host cytochrome _cd_$_1$ using ion
exchange chromatography. The transformation of _Ps. aeruginosa_ PAO1 with the expression
plasmid pMMBSE is described and the remainder of the chapter focuses on the expression of
the cloned _nirS_ gene under different growth conditions, attempts to partially purify the
expressed protein and initial analyses of the spectroscopic features and activity of the
enzyme obtained.

## Results
### Transformation of _Ps. aeruginosa_ PAO1 with the plasmid pMMBSE
The plasmid used to investigate expression of the _nirS_ gene from _T. pantotropha_ in
_Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ PAO1 was pMMBSE, construction and details of which were
described in Chapter 4. The plasmid was transferred to _Ps. aeruginosa_ by mobilisation from
the donor _E. coli_ strain S17-1. Mated cells were plated on _Pseudomonas_ selective medium
(Materials and Methods), containing 250 $\mu$g ml$^{-1}$ carbenicillin, to obtain colonies of _Ps. aeruginosa_ containing the plasmid. Single colonies so selected were picked, grown up in LB medium plus 250 $\mu$g ml$^{-1}$ carbenicillin and tested for the presence of plasmid pMMBSE
using plasmid purification (Promega Wizard miniprep) followed by restriction analysis with
the enzyme _HindIII_. Figure 5.1 shows agarose gels of the digests from several colonies of _Ps. aeruginosa_.

```{r fig5-1, fig.cap="Re-isolation of intact plasmid pMMBSE from _Ps. aeruginosa_ PAO1. Plasmid pMMBSE was introduced into _Ps. aeruginosa_ PAO1 by conjugal transfer from _E. coli_ S17-1. Following selection, the plasmid was isolated using the Promega Wizard miniprep kit and digested with _HindIII_. The fragments were separated by electrophoresis on a 0.8% agarose gel.

Wizard minipreps from _Ps. aeruginosa_ PAO1 were of consistently good quality and always yielded the expected fragments from the pMMBSE digest.

### Analysis of expression from pMMBSE in _Ps. aeruginosa_ PAO1 under different growth conditions
_Ps. aeruginosa_ was found to be a convenient organism for the study of expression
under different growth conditions, as it grew vigorously both aerobically in LB medium and
anaerobically in LB plus 50 mM potassium nitrate. To analyse the growth of transformed
cells, 50 ml cultures of _Ps. aeruginosa_ PAO1 and _Ps. aeruginosa_ PAO1 [pMMBSE] were
grown either aerobically, aerobically plus 50 mM KNO$_3$ or anaerobically. Additionally,
cultures carrying the pMMBSE plasmid under each condition could be induced using 1 mM
IPTG during the early exponential growth phase (Rothmel et al., 1991 [@rothmel_genetic_1991]). This set of
conditions gave rise to nine different cultures, detailed in Table 5.1.

Growth was recorded by the increase in absorbance at 650 nm until stationary phase was reached and the resulting curves are shown in Figure 5.2.

```


Aerobically, the growth of all cultures was the same, regardless of the presence of IPTG or nitrate. However,
anaerobically, _Ps. aeruginosa_ [pMMBSE] showed a marked growth defect, entered
stationary phase much earlier than the wild-type and reached a lower final optical density of
around 0.6. This occurred even in the absence of induction with IPTG. To investigate the
defect further, cultures of _Ps. aeruginosa_ and _Ps. aeruginosa_ [pMMBSE] plus or minus
IPTG were again grown anaerobically over a 13 hour period and their growth curves
recorded. To estimate the level of nitrite reductase activity in each culture, 1 ml samples
taken at each time point on the growth curve were harvested and the supernatant was assayed
colorimetrically for the presence of nitrite. These data are shown in Figure 5.3.

In all samples, the nitrite concentration rose to a maximum of around 3.4 mM near the end of the
exponential growth phase. In wild-type cells, it then declined very rapidly, to undetectable
levels within two hours. In contrast nitrite concentration remained near the maximum level
reached in _Ps. aeruginosa_ [pMMBSE], regardless of induction, throughout stationary phase.
Samples of these cultures assayed after a further 12 hours contained similar levels of nitrite
(not shown).

The nine different cultures used to obtain the first set of growth curves were
harvested and total soluble extracts were prepared by sonication and ultracentrifugation.
Samples from each extract were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained for protein using
Coomassie Blue (Figure 5.4).

```

The region in which cytochrome _cd_$_1$ is found stained quite
densely, but a clear band of 63 kDa, (which corresponds to the size of mature cytochrome
_cd_$_1$ from _T. pantotropha_) was visible in the induced sample grown aerobically and
anaerobically with nitrate. The same band was not clearly seen in induced, anaerobically
grown samples due to their poor growth (data not shown). A band running with slightly
lower mobility was observed in the samples from wild-type cells grown aerobically plus
nitrate and anaerobically; this band corresponded to the endogenous cytochrome _cd_$_1$ which
has a slightly lower molecular weight than its counterpart from _T. pantotropha_ (Table 3.4.
Chapter 3). To compare the effect on expression of growth under either aerobic or anaerobic
conditions an identical set of samples, except for _Ps. aeruginosa_ [pMMBSE] grown
aerobically with nitrate, were again separated by SDS-PAGE under the same conditions,
transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane by semi-dry electroblotting and probed with the _P. denitrificans_ cytochrome _cd_$_1$ antibody. The Western blot is shown in Figure 5.5.

include_graphics(path = "figure/reed.jpg")
```

Only two samples tested positive with this antibody, those from _Ps. aeruginosa_ [pMMBSE] grown
aerobically or anaerobically and induced with IPTG. Each sample showed a band of the
same mobility as native purified cytochrome _cd_$_1$ from _T. pantotropha_, with a more intense
staining reaction in the anaerobic sample. The latter sample also showed a smeared high
molecular weight band, near the top of the gel.

Next, the _c_-type cytochrome content of each sample was analysed by SDS-PAGE
followed by staining for covalently attached haem. In all samples grown aerobically the only
detectable band was that of the low molecular weight cytochrome _c_$_{551}$ (9 kDa); this was seen
only on gels of 10% acrylamide or more (not shown). 100 $\mu$g of protein from the
anaerobically and aerobically plus nitrate grown samples was separated on 8% acrylamide
gels and stained for haem (Figure 5.6).

include_graphics(path = "figure/reed.jpg")
```

A doublet of around 60 kDa was seen in the lane
containing extract from anaerobically-grown _Ps. aeruginosa_ and in the extract from cells
grown aerobically with nitrate; this doublet corresponded to the endogenous cytochrome _cd_$_1$.
In samples from cells containing plasmid pMMBSE but not induced with IPTG, the intensity
of this band was greatly attenuated (lane 2). When the cultures were induced (lane 3), the
band was again attenuated and a new doublet of slightly higher molecular weight appeared.
The latter doublet stained most strongly in the aerobically grown cultures plus nitrate (lane
6) and had the same mobility as purified cytochrome _cd_$_1$ from _T. pantotropha_ (lane 7).
These experiments showed that the _nirS_ gene from _T. pantotropha_ expressed to a
hich level in _Ps. aeruginosa_ PAO1 when induced with IPTG, particularly under anaerobic
denitrifying growth conditions. The next step was to attempt a partial purification of the
recombinant protein. A 1 l culture of _Ps. aeruginosa_ [pMMBSE] was grown anaerobically
to early exponential phase, induced with 1 mM IPTG and grown for a further 10 hours to a
final A$_{650}$ of about 0.8. The cells were harvested and an attempt to prepare a periplasmic
extract was made by spheroplasting in the normal way, except for the omission of EDTA
which was found to cause cell lysis. The extract obtained was extremely pale brown in
colour, and so it was decided to improve the extraction at the expense of initial purity by
using a total soluble extract, prepared as before by sonication and ultracentrifugation. This
extract was applied to a small DEAE-Sepharose column (1 x 10 cm), previously equilibrated
with 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, washed with several column volumes of the same buffer and
eluted with a 250 ml linear gradient of 0-400 mM NaCl in the same buffer. However, it was
noticed that after application of the sample to the column the flow rate became very
irregular. The elution profile, obtained by measuring the A$_{410}$ of the fractions was also very
irregular and no peaks corresponding to the elution of haem proteins could be resolved.

The problem of poor column flow may have occurred for a number of reasons. The
initial hypothesis was that the aggregated material observed on the Western blot of
anaerobically grown induced cell extracts may have been causing a blockage in the column.
However, the aggregate was not observed in aerobic samples and as it is known that in _Ps. aeruginosa_ holocytochrome _cd_$_1$ is expressed aerobically if nitrate is present (Zennaro et al., 1993 [@zennaro_nitrite_1993]), it was thought possible that some recombinant holoprotein might be produced under
the same conditions, but without the risk of aggregation. To achieve this a 1 l culture was
grown in a 5 1 flask with low shaking (100 rpm), induced as before and harvested after 10
hours. Additional steps were taken to reduce the risk of poor performance during the ion
exchange chromatography. First, as lysed cells of _Ps. aeruginosa_ produce substantial
amounts of polysaccharides and DNA, the harvested cells were broken by a freeze-thaw
lysozyme treatment, followed by incubation with 100 U of DNase. This material was
filtered before application to a slightly larger DEAE-Sepharose column (2 x 12 cm) in order
to reduce irregularities in the flow due to surface tension at the column walls. The material
was then eluted using a 250 ml linear gradient of 0-400 mM NaCl as before. This time a
clean, well-resolved elution profile was obtained, as shown in Figure 5.7.

```{r fig5-7, fig.cap="Elution profile during ion-exchange chromatography of soluble extract from _Ps. aeruginosa_ [pMMBSE] grown semi-aerobically with nitrate and induced using IPTG.

Three peaks of absorbance at 410 nm were seen, eluting at approximately 125, 225 and 250 mM NaCl.

Fractions from around the top of peaks 2 and 3 were run on an 8% acrylamide SDS
PAGE gel, along with a sample of total soluble extract from _Ps. aeruginosa_ [pMMBSE]
grown anaerobically and induced with 1 mM IPTG, and stained for covalently-bound haem (Figure 5.8).

include_graphics(path = "figure/reed.jpg")
```

Fractions from both peaks showed a single haem-staining doublet with
identical mobility. The doublet was also seen in the total soluble extract and appeared
slightly higher in the gel than a second band which corresponded to the endogenous
cytochrome _cd_$_1$ at about 60 kDa. The doublet in the samples from both peak 2 and peak 3
therefore corresponded to expressed _T. pantotropha_ cytochrome _cd_$_1$.

The eluted fractions from the DEAE-Sepharose column were very dilute and so the
top fractions from peaks 2 and 3 were pooled and each pool was concentrated to about 1 ml
by centrifugation in an Amicon-30 microconcentrator. Following concentration, the material
from peak 2 was pale pink, whereas that from peak 3 was orange-brown. The spectra of the
concentrated fractions were recorded. Figure 5.9a and 5.9b shows a spectrum of the material
from peak 2; absorbance maxima were observed at 289, 415, 522, 548 and 554 nm.

```{r fig5-9, fig.cap="UV-visible spectrum of concentrated fractions eluting under peak 2 following DEAE-Sepharose chromatography.

Five fractions from the top of peak 3 (Figure 5.7) were pooled and concentrated to approximately 1 ml by centrifugation in an Amicon-10 microconcentrator.
Absorbance maxima were observed at 286, 409, 523 and 547 nm in the as-isolated form, and 418, 522, 548, 554 and 607 nm in the dithionite-reduced form.

Sodium dithionite was gradually added to a 200 $\mu$l sample of the concentrated peak 3 fractions and
the spectrum was recorded until no further changes were observed. Figure 5.10b shows the
final reduced spectrum, with absorbance peaks at 418, 522, 548, 554 and 607 nm, and a
shoulder at 460 nm. The spectrum was similar to that of holocytochrome _cd_$_1$ from _T. pantotropha_ but not identical; this point is discussed further in the following section.
Changes in the spectrum between the as-isolated and dithionite reduced forms are illustrated by a difference spectrum, shown in Figure 5.11a.

3 minus peak 2 is shown in Figure 5.11b. Similar changes were noted, at 423, 522, 548 and 610 nm.

The concentrated material from peaks 2 and 3 was assayed for oxidase activity using
horse heart cytochrome _c_ as an electron donor, and for nitrite reductase activity using
reduced methyl viologen. Assay traces from these experiments are shown in Figure 5.12.

Peak 2 had no activity as either an oxidase or a nitrite reductase. Peak 3 showed a very low

The nitrite reductase activity was higher but was more variable; approximately 290 +/- 90
nmol of methyl viologen was oxidised per minute per mg of protein. Attempts to relate these
figures to the turnover number of purified cytochrome _cd_$_1$ are discussed in the following
section.

## Discussion
_Ps aeruginosa_ PAO1 was chosen as a suitable candidate for expression studies based
on the criteria outlined in Section 5.1, one of which was its genetic amenability. It was one
of the organisms tested in the original construction of plasmid pMMB67EH (Furste et al., 1986 [@furste_molecular_1986])
and the early experiments in this chapter showed that transformation and plasmid
purification from the strain are quite straightforward (Figure 5.1). Having successfully
introduced the plasmid into _Ps. aeruginosa_ PAO1, the next objective was to investigate the
growth of the transformed cells.

Aerobically, the growth of all cultures was similar, regardless of the presence of
nitrate or induction by IPTG (Figure 5.2). This was similar to the result obtained using _E. coli_ JM83 in Chapter 4. However, anaerobically there was a pronounced growth defect in
cells carrying pMMBSE regardless of whether IPTG was present. These cultures reached a
maximum absorbance at 650 nm of only around 0.6-0.8 compared to around 1.6 in the wild
type cultures and entered stationary phase earlier. The cell pellets from anaerobic cultures
containing pMMBSE were also much paler when harvested. In _E. coli_ there was some
suggestion of an anaerobic growth defect but it was not clear how marked this was, because
the combined stress of countering the antibiotic and growing in the minimal medium affected
growth regardless of the presence of the _nirS_ gene on the plasmid. The growth of cultures of
_Ps. aeruginosa_ containing only pMMB67EH was not tested but even so, the anaerobic
growth defect in cultures containing pMMBSE is clearly much more pronounced.

The concentration of nitrite in the culture medium under anaerobic condition was
measured, to assess whether a build up of toxic nitrite was responsible for the poor growth of
cells containing plasmid pMMBSE. Figure 5.3 shows that in both induced and non-induced
cultures of _Ps. aeruginosa_ [pMMBSE], nitrite accumulates to a similar maximum level as
seen in the wild-type, but then remains at this concentration, rather than rapidly disappearing
from the medium. This indicates that for some reason, nitrite reduction is compromised in
cells containing pMMBSE. The haem stained gel of extracts from each culture under
different growth conditions (Figure 5.6) shows that levels of the endogenous cytochrome _cd_$_1$
are substantially attenuated in cells containing pMMBSE. It appears that for some reason the
presence of the pMMBSE plasmid under anaerobic conditions leads to attenuated expression
of the endogenous cytochrome _cd_$1$. This in turn prevents the removal of nitrite produced
from the nitrate reductase activity of the cells and eventually leads to the premature cessation
of growth. The observation also suggests that any activity of the expressed _T. pantotropha_
_nirS_ gene product is not sufficient to lower the nitrite concentration.

As this effect occurs only in cells containing pMMBSE under anaerobic conditions
regardless of induction, it is inferred that the effect is linked to a factor on the plasmid which
is only active anaerobically. One possible candidate might be the NNR binding site which is
present on pMMBSE. _Ps. aeruginosa_ contains at least two proteins of the FNR family,
named ANR (Sawers, 1991 [@sawers_identification_1991]) and DNR (Arai et al., 1995 [@arai_expression_1995]). The second of these is in the same
phylogenetic group as the NNR protein (de Boer, 1996 [@de_boer_regulation_1996]) and could conceivably interact with
the NNR binding site, to which it would not normally be exposed. This might reduce levels
of the protein and lead to the down-regulation of the endogenous nitrite reductase. However,
there are arguments against this interpretation. First, the plasmid pMMBSE is quite low in
copy number; the exact number of copies per cell is not known, but is likely to be in the
order of 12 copies (Frey et al., 1992 [@frey_replication_1992]), as the plasmid is based on the RSF1010 replicon. If
the DNR (or ANR) molecule is expressed in a similar way to the FNR protein in _E. coli_, it
could be present at around 2 400 copies per cell (Unden and Duchêne, 1987 [@unden_role_1987]) and so would
be unlikely to be titrated out by the plasmid. A fall in free concentration of DNR/ANR
under anaerobic conditions might also be expected to be compensated for by autoregulation,
which is seen in the case of the FNR gene (Spiro and Guest, 1987 [@spiro_regulation_1987]). However these
arguments are based on analogy to FNR and as we know little of how DNR/ANR works
there may still be a case for interaction between this molecule and the NNR binding site on
pMMBSE, which is not understood at present.

The only other relevant portion of the pMMBSE plasmid is the truncated _nirE_ gene,
the first 648 bp of which are present in this construct. This encodes 216 out of a total 287
amino acids and it may be that the truncated protein is expressed under anaerobic growth, so
interfering with the normal regulation of denitrification in _Ps. aeruginosa_ and leading to the
effects detailed above. Possible effects of the plasmid-borne NNR binding site and the _nirE_
gene could be clarified by control experiments, examining the growth of cultures containing
plasmid pMMB67EH, plasmids that carried only the NNR binding site or only the _nirS_
structural gene. The nature of the anaerobic growth defect is, therefore, quite complex and
not understood at present, though its main practical consequence is a reduced cell yield, to be
taken into account when considering the amount of recombinant cytochrome _cd_$_1$ that might
be obtained.

Expression of the _nirS_ gene from pMMBSE in _Ps. aeruginosa_ is similar to that seen
in _E. coli_ JM83, in that expression only occurs following induction with IPTG, when cells
are grown either aerobically or anaerobically. This indicates that the _T. pantotropha_ _nirS_
promoter is non-functional in _Ps. aeruginosa_. Both _T. pantotropha_ (Steinrücke and Ludwig,
1993 [@steinrucke_genetics_1993]) and _Ps. aeruginosa_ (West and Ingewski, 1988 [@west_codon_1988]) have a higher genomic G+C content
than _E. coli_, but apparently there is no precedent for a GC-based promoter structure based
solely upon a higher G+C genomic content. These results also demonstrate that the _tac_
promoter and the _lacI_$^q$ gene are functional in _Ps. aeruginosa_, a result consistent with
previous studies (Fujita and Anemura, 1992 [@fujita_vitro_1992], Brunschwig and Darzins, 1992 [@brunschwig_two-component_1992]). The expressed
cytochrome _cd_$_1$ is the same size as the native _T. pantotropha_ protein and has _c_-type haem
attached, indicating that as in _E. coli_, translocation to the periplasm and subsequent
processing have occurred normally. When expressed anaerobically a smeared band of high
molecular weight was observed by Western blotting, in addition to the cytochrome _cd_$_1$ band
(Figure 5.5). This appears to be aggregated cytochrome _cd_$_1$ rather than a different cross
reacting protein; the anti-cytochrome _cd_$_1$ antibody is very specific, as shown by its lack of
reactivity towards the cytochrome _cd_$_1$ of _Ps. aeruginosa_ (and also _Ps. stutzeri_, not shown).
This observation is in agreement with previous immunological studies, in which an antibody
to cytochrome _cd_$_1$ from _Ps. stutzeri_ ATCC 14405 was found to be almost strain specific,
reacting only weakly with the protein from only a very few other strains of _Ps. stutzeri_
(Ward et al., 1993 [@ward_antibody_1993]). The aggregated material may originate _in vivo_ or during sample boiling
prior to SDS-PAGE, but the former explanation appears more likely as this phenomenon was
specific to extracts from anaerobically-grown induced cultures. The protein seems to be
expressed at a higher level in _Ps. aeruginosa_ compared to _E. coli_ under these conditions and
this may contribute to the aggregation problem; aggregation of over-expressed proteins,
including those found in the periplasm has been described previously _e.g._ for T-cell receptor
protein (Wulfing and Pluckthun, 1994 [@wulfing_correctly_1994]), insulin-like growth factor-1 (Wong et al., 1988 [@wong_expression_1988]) and
anti-influenza neuraminidase antibody NC41 (Kortt et al., 1995 [@kortt_solution_1995]).

Attempts to partially purify recombinant cytochrome _cd_$_1$ from _Ps. aeruginosa_ PAO1
proved to be quite challenging. To begin with the cells cannot be spheroplasted in the
normal way to release the periplasm, as they are prone to lysis in the presence of EDTA.
Other attempts at spheroplasting that omitted EDTA or used a washing step with 0.2 M
MgCl$_2$ (Cheng et al., 1970 [@cheng_alkaline_1970]) yielded an extract with an extremely pale colour and so it was
decided to begin the purification with a total soluble extract from sonicated cells. However,
extract from anaerobically grown cells could not be eluted cleanly from a small DEAE
Sepharose ion exchange column. The flow rate under these circumstances was very uneven
and a resolved elution profile was not obtainable. This occurred several times, even after
extensive ultracentrifugation of the extract. It was assumed initially that the aggregated
material seen by Western blotting might be causing a blockage in the column, leading to the
uneven elution observed. Other possible causes include the presence of polysaccharide or
nucleic acids in the sample. The use of a small column (1 x 10 cm) may have contributed to
the poor resolution, due to disturbances in the flow caused by surface-tension effects across
the narrow column diameter. However, this did not seem to be a major problem during
purification of soluble extract from _E. coli_ JM83 (see Figure 4.12, Chapter 4), or during
other purifications.

To alleviate the possible effects of all the factors outlined above, a number of
changes were made to the procedure. First, _Ps. aeruginosa_ PAO1 [pMMBSE] was grown
and induced aerobically in the presence of 50 mM potassium nitrate. The rationale for this
approach was that the protein is expressed aerobically following induction as shown by
Western blotting but the aggregated material is not observed and, additionally, it is been
shown that the presence of nitrate under aerobic conditions in _Ps. aeruginosa_ is sufficient to
promote the synthesis of active holocytochrome _cd_$_1$ (and therefore _d_$_1$ haem, Zennaro et al.,
1993 [@zennaro_nitrite_1993]). Cultures of 1 l volume were grown in 5 l flasks at a low shaking rate in the hope that
this would lower the oxygen tension to some degree, increasing the expression of nitrite
reductase but preventing aggregation. Additionally, the cells were lysed by a lysozyme
freeze-thaw treatment to reduce polysaccharides and after centrifugation, the viscous
supernatant was treated with DNase and filtered. Finally the column diameter was increased
to 2 cm and the gradient was run against gravity to improve resolution (Scopes, 1987 [@scopes_protein_1987]). The
orange-brown soluble extract obtained was bound to the column, washed and eluted and this
time an even flow rate was observed with a clean, well-resolved elution profile exhibiting
three peaks (Figure 5.7). Haem-staining of the fractions from the top of each peak showed
that peaks 2 and 3 contained a _c_-type cytochrome with the same mobility as the native
cytochrome _cd_$_1$ from _T. pantotropha_ (Figure 5.11). This is what would be expected were the
cytochromes to be semi-apo (peak 2) and holo- (peak 3) cytochrome _cd_$_1$; the latter protein
elutes at around 250 mM NaCl, with the semi-apo protein eluting slightly earlier on anion
exchange columns. A haem-stained sample of total extract from this culture (lane 1) shows
clearly that the cytochromes from peaks 2 and 3 correspond to the band that appears in this
culture on induction with IPTG, which is slightly higher than the endogenous cytochrome
_cd_$_1$ band. It was therefore clear that both peaks, 2 and 3, contained recombinant _T. pantotropha_ cytochrome _cd_$_1$.

Spectroscopy was used to characterise further the proteins from each of the three
peaks. Peak 1 exhibited a broad peak at 405 nm as isolated, and two peaks at 425 and
557 nm in the dithionite-reduced form. These features indicate a haem-containing protein,
possibly a _b_- or _c_-type cytochrome. The sample was not investigated further. Peak 2
exhibited absorbance maxima that identified it as being semi-apo cytochrome _cd_$_1$. The
spectrum was virtually identical to that of the recombinant semi-apo cytochrome cd isolated
from _E. coli_ JM83 (Chapter 4) and to that of the chemically-prepared semi-apo protein in the
reduced state. Peak 3 had a stronger A$_{410}$ absorbance than peak 2. The spectrum of the
pooled fractions from the peak (Figure 5.9a) exhibited peak absorbances at 409, 523, 547
and 628 nm. Overall, the spectrum resembled cytochrome _cd_$_1$ in the oxidised state, but the
slight (red-shift) of the _c_-haem $\beta$ and $\gamma$ bands and the small absorbance at 547 nm indicated
that a small proportion of the enzyme was reduced. Absorbance in the 600-700 nm region
was small but significant, indicating the presence of _d_$_1$ haem.

Several small additions of sodium dithionite resulted in a gradual reduction of the
protein and the final recorded spectrum is shown in Figure 5.9b. This spectrum had peak
absorbances at 418, 522, 548, 554 and 607 nm. There was a pronounced shoulder at 460 nm
and the absorbance peak of 607 nm was quite broad, spreading across the 600-650 nm
region. These features are again quite similar to the cytochrome _cd_$_1$ holoprotein in the
reduced form, but there are some significant differences; in Figure 5.9b the absorbance at
460 nm is attenuated compared to the native protein. Also, the absorbance in the 600-650
nm region is different, with the peak absorbance significantly blue-shifted and comprising a
single broad absorbance. However, difference spectra of the reduced minus as-isolated
material from peak 3 (Figure 5.10a) and of the reduced peak 3 minus peak 2 (Figure 5.10b)
indicate that the changes in the reduced spectrum of material from peak 3 have occurred in
regions where _d_$_1$ haem absorbs, at 460 nm and in the 600-650 nm region.

Table 5.2 shows the ratios of some of the peak absorbances in the spectra of the
semiapo- and putative holocytochrome _cd_$_1$ expressed in _Ps. aeruginosa_, compared with the
native protein from _T. pantotropha_.

These data indicate that the _c_ haem:_d_$_1$ haem ratio is somewhat lower in the expressed material. One explanation for this is that the material is not
spectroscopically pure and may be contaminated with some semi-apo protein because of
incomplete resolution of peaks 2 and 3. However, the peaks appear quite well separated in
the elution profile (Figure 5.7) and spectroscopic analysis of the later fractions from peak 3
before concentration gave similar results to those obtained after concentration (not shown).
A second explanation is that _d_$_1$ haem incorporation differs somewhat in the expressed
protein and this is supported to some extent by analysis of the activity of the expressed
protein. As expected, peak 2, the recombinant semi-apo cytochrome _cd_$_1$ shows neither
oxidase or nitrite reductase activity, in the absence of the _d_$_1$ haem. However, the
recombinant holocytochrome _cd_$_1$ has an oxidase activity of around 4.3 nmol cytochrome _c_
oxidised per minute per mg of protein. Using the extinction coefficient determined for
native cytochrome _cd_$_1$ at 548 nm, this converts to a turnover number of approximately 0.64
min$^{-1}$. Purified native cytochrome _cd_$_1$ from _T. pantotropha_ assayed under the same
conditions gave a turnover number of approximately 3 min$^{-1}$. In contrast, the nitrite
reductase activity seemed less affected in the expressed protein; although these assays were
more variable, a turnover number of around 60 min$^{-1}$ was calculated for the expressed
protein, compared to about 124 min$^{-1}$ for the native protein. However, it may not be
appropriate to use the extinction coefficients determined for the native protein in these
circumstances, due to the spectroscopic changes observed in the recombinant material and
indeed, using different peak absorbances for these calculations gives different estimates of
cytochrome _cd_$_1$ concentration. An approximate idea of cytochrome _cd_$_1$ concentration might
be obtained from measuring the protein concentration of a pure sample, though in this case
not enough material was obtained for further purification. The most reasonable summary of
these results is that the recombinant protein has both oxidase and nitrite reductase activities,
which appear to be somewhat lower than those of the native protein, while spectroscopic
features that indicate the presence of _d_$_1$ haem but suggest that it is not bound in an identical
fashion to that seen in the native protein. Inefficient _d_$_1$ haem incorporation may also explain
why some of the recombinant material was expressed as the semi-apo protein, though it may
also be that under the semi-aerobic growth conditions, insufficient _d_$_1$ haem was produced to
complex with all of the expressed polypeptide.

The observed differences between the expressed and native holocytochromes _cd_$_1$ may
result from improper interactions between the expressed polypeptide and the biosynthetic
apparatus for cytochrome _cd_$_1$ in _Ps. aeruginosa_. Although several homologous genes
involved in cytochrome _cd_$_1$ biosynthesis have been identified in _Ps. aeruginosa_, _Ps. stutzeri_
and _P. denitrificans_, the specific genes found in each organism and their physicaland
arrangement differs (Zumft and Körner, 1997 [@zumft_enzyme_1997]) and it is likely that each system is adapted to
its own specific cytochrome _cd_$_1$ polypeptide to some degree. Another possibility is that
under semi-aerobic conditions a proportion of the haem inserted in to the expressed protein is
not of the _d_$_1$ type, but some other haem. _Ps. aeruginosa_ synthesises a number of haem
molecules including haems _o_ (Matsushita et al., 1980 [@matsushita_membrane-bound_1980]), _a_$_3$ and _a_, (Fujiwara et al., 1992 [@fujiwara_novel_1992]), the
latter of which was shown to insert into semi-apo cytochrome _cd_$_1$ _in vitro_ and result in a low
oxidase activity (Hill and Wharton, 1978 [@hill_reconstitution_1978]). Alternative haems might be identifiable by
organic extraction and spectroscopy of the haem group; this was attempted on a small
amount of the expressed protein but was inconclusive, again due to the small amounts of
material obtained. However, it seems more likely that the protein contains _d_$_1$ haem that is
bound differently from the native protein, as the observed absorbances were in the correct
positions for haem _d_$_1$, if not identical to the native protein, and the colours of the expressed
and native proteins were similar. Notably, incomplete reconstitution of the recombinant
semi-apo protein from _E. coli_ produces cytochrome _cd_$_1$ in which the _d_$_1$ haem absorbance
features observed in the present chapter (a broad absorbance at 600-650 nm with a blue
shifted peak and an attenuated 460 nm peak) are also observed.

The experiments described in this chapter suggest that _Ps. aeruginosa_ is of some use
as a heterologous host for expression of cytochrome _cd_$_1$ from _T. pantotropha_, but there are
disadvantages. The recombinant protein had some activity, which indicates that the system
could be used to determine whether mutants of cytochrome _cd_$_1$ possessed activity when
compared with the native protein. However, the apparent differences in the spectrum of the
expressed protein and in its activity, as compared with the native protein, warrant further
investigation. Additionally, the comments from Chapter 4 pertaining to methods of
improving the levels of expression apply here, as it would be advantageous to obtain more
material for further purification and subsequent analysis. These experiments show that the
method of using a denitrifying heterologous host for expression is a valid one, and it may
also be possible to try expression in other hosts, such as _Ps. stutzeri_ or _A. eutrophus_. The
latter approach may also be advantageous as _Ps. aeruginosa_ is an opportunistically
pathogenic organism that requires some care in handling and, as a further practical
consideration, requires the use of high concentrations of carbenicillin, an expensive
antibiotic, to maintain the plasmid pMMBSE.
